# M&M Cookies

This recipe makes about 50 cookies.

## Ingredients

- 1 C (2 sticks) of soft butter (it is critical that it be soft)
- ½ C sugar
- ½ C packed light brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 2 C regular all-purpose flour (240 g)
- ½ tsp baking soda
- ⅛ tsp salt
- 12-oz package of M&Ms (see my secret in the box near the end of the page)
- ¾ C chopped nuts (optional see my note in the instructions)

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

1. In a mixing bowl, cream together the butter and the sugars until light and fluffy. It is critical that the butter be at room temperature in order to make this step work nicely. [BAT: I've done it with cold butter and it was fine, just took a little longer]

2. Beat in the egg and the vanilla.

3. In another bowl, mix together flour, baking soda and salt.

4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix.

5. The recipe says to STIR in M&Ms and nuts at this point. I always put the M&Ms right in the mixer. I suppose a couple might get broken but if they are it hasn't caused any serious issues and doing it this way is easy and fast. My boys have never taken nuts to school because of children with allergies and, as a result, have gotten used to their cookies without them. Therefore, we always skip the nuts. That's a matter of personal choice.

6. Using tsp [not the measuring kind], drop cookies of about one heaping tsp onto parchment-lined cookie sheets, making them about two inches apart. Be aware that making these cookies too big causes them to spread out and become flat.

7. Bake for between 10 and 13 minutes. I prefer mine cooked less rather than more. Another personal choice but don't overcook them.

8. Cool on wire cookie racks.
