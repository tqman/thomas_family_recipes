Garlicky Beef Tenderloin With Orange Horseradish Sauce

1 4-pound beef tenderloin
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
1 fat garlic clove, coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 cups crème fraîche
1/4 cup white horseradish
Grated zest of half an orange

Season the tenderloin all over with the salt, pepper, rosemary and
garlic. Cover the meat and refrigerate for at least two hours and
preferably overnight. Let it come to room temperature for 1 hour
before roasting

Heat oven to 450 degrees. Wipe off as much garlic as possible. (It
tends to burn.)

In a large, ovenproof skillet over high heat, heat the oil. Add the
meat and thoroughly brown all over, 4 to 5 minutes per side. (If your
skillet isn’t large enough, cut the meat in half.)

Place the skillet on the oven’s middle rack and roast until an
instant-read thermometer shows 120 degrees (for rare), 10 to 20
minutes. Let the meat rest for 10 minutes before carving.

In a small bowl, whisk the crème fraîche, horseradish and orange
zest. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve alongside the
tenderloin.
