3. Mix all the wet into the dry, stirring vigorously and for as short a period of time as possible.

### Variations

**Egg Nog Pancakes:** Replace the buttermilk with egg nog, drop the baking soda and add 1¼ tsp sesame oil.

- 20101205: Made egg-nog pancakes with ½ egg-nog and ½ buttermilk, came out much fluffier. Did ½ tsp of sesame oil : 1 C liquid. Also added ⅛ tsp nutmeg : 1 C liquid. Was a little on the dry side - perhaps an additional tablespoon of butter?
- 20101212: Made egg-nog pancakes with all egg-nog. For each 1 C of liquid, put in 1 Tbsp of vinegar and 15 Tbsp of egg-nog. Also added ⅛ tsp cinnamon : 1 C liquid. Think it might like a *little* more sesame oil. Also added 1 extra Tbsp of melted butter, as they'd seemed dry last time.

**Oatmeal Pancakes:** 2:1 oatmeal for ¼ the flour. So, for example, if making 1C white and 1C whole wheat, do .5C whole wheat and 1C oatmeal. Soak the oatmeal in the buttermilk overnight, the night before. Did this 20080217, was just a *tad* dry, might do ⅓C whole wheat.
