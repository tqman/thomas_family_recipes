# Soy Lime Wasabi Ginger Marinade

## Ingredients

- 7 cloves garlic, chopped
- Big ol' chunk of chopped ginger
- ⅓ C soy sauce
- ⅓ C sake
- ¼ C simple syrup (or, ½ C mirin, no sake)
- 1 Tbsp wasabi powder
- Juice of one lime
- 2 Tbsp stir fry oil

## Notes

Was great on tuna, 20080609. Could probably double the wasabi, safely.
