1 stick (8 Tbsp unsalted butter)
1 Tbsp unsalted butter for greasing pan
240 g cornmeal (good quality stone ground cornmeal preferred)
60 g all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
2 tsp kosher salt
2 Tbsp (25 gr) sugar
1 1/2 cup (355 ml) buttermilk
2 large eggs

Preheat the oven to 450F.

Melt the stick of butter in the cast iron skillet.

If you do not have buttermilk, place 21g (1 1/2 Tbsp) vinegar in a
multi-cup measure and fill to 1 1/2C with milk.

Beat eggs in a small bowl.

Whisk together dry ingredients. Add wet ingredients (including stick
of butter) and stir to combine.

Pour the batter in the cast iron skillet and bake for 20 minutes or
until a tester comes out with moist crumb from the center.

Immediately after removing it from the oven, spread the remaining
butter over the top of the cornbread and let it melt in.
