# Chocolate Chip Raspberry Muffins

## Ingredients

- 1 3/4 C flour
- 3/4 C sugar
- 1 Tbsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 3/4 C chocolate chips
- 1/3 C vegetable oil or melted butter
- 3/4 C low-fat milk
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 tsp vanilla
- 36-48 fresh raspberries (3-4 per muffin)

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners or grease well.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Stir in the chocolate chips.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, vanilla, and oil (or melted butter) until well combined.

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir gently with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula until just combined. The batter should be slightly lumpy - do not overmix or the muffins will be tough.

Divide the batter evenly among the 12 muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full. Press 3-4 fresh raspberries into the top of each muffin, pushing them down slightly into the batter.

Bake for 28-32 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean (it may have melted chocolate on it, but no wet batter). The tops should be golden brown and spring back when lightly touched.

Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Makes 12 muffins.

## Notes

I strongly suspect (but have not checked) that you could replace the raspberries with 1 1/2 C any fresh fruit and have something good.
