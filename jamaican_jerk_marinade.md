Totally different idea 20190412:

1 tsp orange zest
juice of 1 large fresh orange
1 Tbsp olive oil
juice of 1 lime
1 tsp minced fresh ginger
2 garlic cloves, smashed
½ tsp dried red pepper
½ tsp oregano
½ tsp allspice
1 Tbsp soy sauce

Original recipe had no salt, and it needed it.

---
2 medium yellow onions
2 scallions, chopped
3 cloves garlic
2 hot peppers, chopped (Scotch peppers are traditional, can skip for
  Meg, or 1 tsp ground red pepper for Meg)
4 tsp sugar
1 tsp salt
1 tsp ground thyme (or 4 tsp fresh thyme)
2 tsp ground Jamaican Allspice
2 tsp black pepper
1 tsp ground nutmeg
1 tsp cinnamon
6 Tbsp soy sauce
2 Tbsp olive oil
2 Tbsp cider vinegar

Put it all in the blender and liquify it.  Looks like lime juice is a
common addition, but I don't have any (10/12/10).
