# Jamaican Jerk Marinade

## Ingredients

### Totally different idea (2019 version)

- 1 tsp orange zest
- Juice of 1 large fresh orange
- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- Juice of 1 lime
- 1 tsp minced fresh ginger
- 2 garlic cloves, smashed
- ½ tsp dried red pepper
- ½ tsp oregano
- ½ tsp allspice
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce

### Original version

- 2 medium yellow onions
- 2 scallions, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic
- 2 hot peppers, chopped (Scotch peppers are traditional, can skip for Meg, or 1 tsp ground red pepper for Meg)
- 4 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp ground thyme (or 4 tsp fresh thyme)
- 2 tsp ground Jamaican Allspice
- 2 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 6 Tbsp soy sauce
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 2 Tbsp cider vinegar

## Instructions

### 2019 version

Combine all ingredients. Original recipe had no salt, and it needed it.

### Original version

Put it all in the blender and liquify it. Looks like lime juice is a common addition, but I don't have any (10/12/10).
