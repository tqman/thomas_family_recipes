Made "single serving" with a 4 pound chicken, skinless, cooked it one hour
and it came out great (with 30 minutes smoking, flipped once, basting at
flip).  Might be able to bake it 55 minutes and smoke it longer, though.

Also - probably not a bad idea to pre-mix the sauce. Oh, also, also,
forgot to grease the pan (used the Corningware) and it worked fine.

The notes below the dashes date from before now. I've been making the
"single serving" with a whole cut-up chicken. Last time we tried it
skin-on, and resolved to try it skin off, this time.

I substituted olive oil (and about half of it) for the butter.

Skin-on, I think, it can take 1 hour, 15 minutes cooking. Skin-off we
made a small chicken at 1 hour, 15 minutes and it was dry - for skin-off
we should probably try 1 hour even.

I think this is my mom's (Grandmom Ginny's) smoked chicken recipie. I
found it in a notebook which seems to date from the upstate NY
years. No cooking times, yet, but here are the ingredients. She thinks
this is a tripling of the original recipie:

16 breasts (about 4 packs)
2 packs of drumsticks
6 cups canned tomato juice (48 oz)
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
8 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon mustard
18 teaspoons worchestershire sauce
4 bay leaves
4 teaspoons sugar
3 cups vinegar
12 tablespoons butter

until done
