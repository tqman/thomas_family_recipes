## New Recipes

When creating new recipes, please use the format found in [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md].

## Recipe-writing style guide

1. All files should be in markdown
2. Use "Tbsp," "tsp," "C," "lbs," and "oz" instead of longer expressions
3. Numbers should be expressed as digits; "1 C" not "one C"
4. Non-integer values should be expressed as fraction characters. E.g., "⅓" and not "1/3" or ".333"
