#Bleu Cheese and Bacon with Bourbon Glaze:

##Ingredients
- Bleu cheese
- 1 strip of bacon per burger
- Bourbon glaze

##Bourbon Glaze
- 2 Tbsp bourbon
- 2 Tbsp brown sugar
- 2 Tbsp water
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper

Mix all items together in a small saucepan. Cook until slightly
thickened and simmering

##Burger assembly
Cook the bacon separately first, only use it to top the burgers. Place
the bleu cheese on the burgers in the last couple of minutes of
cooking to let it melt, then top with a bacon piece broken in
half. Toast the buns and put the glaze on the top.
