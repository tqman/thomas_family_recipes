# French Press Coffee

## Ingredients

- 25 g coffee per 300 g water (coarse-ground)
- Alternatively: One mug of coffee is 225 g of water, and 15 g of coffee.

## Instructions

Add coarse-ground coffee to the French Press. Heat water to 205 degrees F. Add water to French Press. Wait 30 - 45 seconds, and stir. Wait 6 minutes, and plunge.

## Notes

20190401: I now use 25g coffee : 300g water

20160811: 20g was better, but I ground it fine. Was a little bitter, but a lot stronger.

20160810: 15g seemed a bit weak. Perhaps 20g?
