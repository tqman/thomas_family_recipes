# Grilled Flatbread

## Ingredients

- 1 C warm water
- 3 Tbsp milk
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1/4 C olive oil
- 2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast
- 1/4 C sugar
- 2 tsp salt
- 4 1/2 C bread flour
- Olive oil

## Instructions

Disolve the yeast in warm water, and let stand until frothy (5-10 minutes). Put all the other ingredients together, then knead for 6-8 minutes, or until smooth.

Place the dough in an oiled, covered bowl and let rise for one hour.

Punch down the dough, and pinch off golf-ball sized balls. Set these aside and let them rest for 30 minutes.

After 30 minutes, light the grill (assuming you're using charcoal), and roll the balls out into thin circles. When the grill is hot, each piece should be brushed with oil, and grilled on each side for approximately two minutes.
