1 sm. onion, chopped
1 head of garlic (12 cloves), chopped
4 28 oz cans whole San Marazano tomatoes
some pepper :)
1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
1½ tsp dried oregano
½C fresh chopped basil (or, 1½ Tbsp of dried)
2 bay leaves
1C red wine
1 tsp sugar salt

If making in a slow cooker, drain the tomatoes.

Crush the tomatoes by hang in a large bowl.

In a large pot, Saute the onion and until the onion is translucent, in
olive oil. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30
seconds). Add the chopped tomatoes to the pot. Add the vinegar,
oregano, bay leaves, red wine, and basil (if dried) to pot and simmer
for six hours. Add the basil (if fresh) and 1 tsp sugar (or more or
less to taste) and serve.

You may also cook this in a slow cooker; in which case, saute the
onion and garlic in a sautee pan and then add them and the other
ingredients to the slow cooker and cook on low for 8 hours.
