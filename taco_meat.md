# Taco Meat

## Ingredients

- 1 lbs ground beef
- 1 onion, diced
- 1 pepper, diced
- 7 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp chili powder
- ½ tsp cumin
- ¼ tsp cayenne pepper
- ¼ tsp dried oregano

## Instructions

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 5-7 minutes. Drain excess fat if desired.

Add the diced onion and pepper to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.

Add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Add the salt, chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, and oregano. Stir to combine and cook for 1-2 minutes to toast the spices.

Use immediately for tacos, burritos, or other dishes.
