# Pan Sauce

## Ingredients

- ⅛ tsp xanthan gum
- 2 C deglazing liquid
- 1 small sliced shallot
- 3 Tbsp butter

## Instructions

1. Put the shallot in the hot pan, and sautee for 30 seconds.
2. Add deglazing liquid, bring to a boil, and scrape the fond into it.
3. Boil until liquid is substantially reduced and thickened (but not until it's bubbling like crazy - "coat the back of a spoon" thick).
4. Add the 3 Tbsp of butter to pan and melt it.
5. Pour everything into immersion blender cup, add xanthan gum, and blend until consistent sauce.

## Notes

- Use .15g of xanthan gum to 100g of liquid
- Do ½ C liquid : 3 Tbsp butter
