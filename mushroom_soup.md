# Mushroom Soup

## Ingredients

- 6 tablespoons butter
- 1 onion, thinly sliced
- 12 ounces button mushrooms, halved
- 4 cups chicken stock
- 1 sprig parsley
- 2 ounces sherry
- Salt and pepper

## Instructions

Over medium heat, melt 2 Tbsp of the butter in a saucepan. Toss in the onion and cook until soft but not browned.

Toss in the remaining butter and then add the mushrooms. Cook for 8 minutes.

Pour in the chicken stock, add the parsley, and bring to a boil. When bubbling, reduce to a simmer and cook for an hour.

Pour soup into a blender (you might need to do this in stages), and process until smooth. Return to the saucepan and bring to a simmer. Pour in the sherry, and season with salt and pepper.

## Notes

20131013 - Added in coarsely chopped, 2 sprigs each or rosemary and thyme, with the mushrooms.

I'm substituting 2 ounces brandy for the sherry, and putting in 4 cloves of garlic
