# Miso-Roasted Asparagus

## Ingredients

- 1 pound (1 large bunch) asparagus
- 2 Tbsp sugar
- ¼ C hot water
- ¼ C white or light miso paste

## Instructions

Position an oven rack 6 inches under the broiler element and preheat the broiler (to high if your broiler has different settings).

Trim the bottom 1 inch off the asparagus stalks. If any are bigger than a pencil, use a vegetable peeler to peel an additional 2 or 3 inches' worth of the skin from the bottom of the stalks.

Whisk together the sugar and water in a small bowl, stirring until the sugar dissolves, then whisk in the miso paste.

Arrange the asparagus in a single layer in a shallow roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet. Spoon the miso mixture over the asparagus, turning the stalks so they are evenly coated.

Broil until the asparagus is lightly browned and the miso is bubbling, 6 to 8 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
