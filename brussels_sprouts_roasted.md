# Roasted Brussels Sprouts

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 lb Brussels sprouts, trimmed and split in half
- 3 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

Adjust oven rack to upper-third position, place a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet on it, and preheat oven to 500°F.

Toss sprouts with olive oil and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Remove baking sheet from oven and add Brussels sprouts, working quickly to turn them all cut-side-down.

Return to oven and roast until tender and deeply browned, about 20 minutes total.

Serve immediately.
