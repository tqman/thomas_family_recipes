6 cloves garlic, chopped
1 stick unsalted butter

Put 1 Tbsp of the butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat and melt
it.

Add the chopped garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until the garlic
is fragrant and just beginning to turn golden, about 2-3 minutes. Do
not let the garlic brown or it will become bitter.

Add the remaining butter to the saucepan. Reduce heat to low and melt
the butter slowly. Do not let the butter boil - it should just barely
simmer. Cook gently for 15-20 minutes, allowing the water to evaporate
and the milk solids to separate.

After 15-20 minutes, remove the pan from heat and let it sit for 2-3
minutes to allow the milk solids to settle to the bottom.

Carefully pour the clear golden liquid through a fine-mesh strainer
lined with cheesecloth into a clean container, leaving the white milk
solids and garlic pieces at the bottom of the pan. Discard the solids.

The clarified garlic butter can be stored covered in the refrigerator
for up to 1 month.
