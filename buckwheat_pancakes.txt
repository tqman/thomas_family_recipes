100g buckwheat flour
100g unbleached white all-purpose flour
2 Tbsp sugar
1 Tbsp(10 grams) baking powder
1 tsp(5 grams) baking soda
1/2 tsp (2.5 grams) salt
2 C buttermilk
4 Tbsp(85 grams) unsalted butter, melted
2 eggs (220 grams)

Additional butter or oil for cooking

In a large bowl, whisk together the buckwheat flour, all-purpose flour,
sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, melted
butter, and eggs until well combined.

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir with a
wooden spoon or silicone spatula until just combined. The batter should
be slightly lumpy - do not overmix or the pancakes will be tough. Let
the batter rest for 5 minutes.

Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat. Add a small amount of
butter or oil to coat the surface.

When the griddle is hot, pour about 1/4 C of batter per pancake onto
the griddle. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look
set, about 2-3 minutes.

Flip the pancakes and cook until golden brown on the second side, about
1-2 minutes more.

Serve immediately with butter and maple syrup, or keep warm in a 200F
oven while cooking remaining pancakes.

Makes about 12 pancakes.
