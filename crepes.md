# Crepes

Crepes for 1 (or two);

## Ingredients

- 1/2 C all-purpose flour
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp sugar
- 1 egg
- 1/4 C milk
- 1/4 C water
- 1 Tbsp butter, melted

## Instructions

Mix flour, salt and sugar in a bowl.

In a second bowl, whisk the eggs until scrambled and combined. Then, gradually temper the egg by slowly pouring the melted butter in as you stir. Then add the water.

Finally, combine and beat until smooth.

Use approximately 1/4C batter for each crepe; cook over medium high heat on a greased crepe pan. Be sure to tilt the pan when you pour in the batter so the batter is as thin as possible. Cook for about two minutes, until the bottom is brown (and the top is dry). Loosen with a spatula, and turn it.
