# Tequila Lima Marinade

## Ingredients

- ½ C fresh lime juice
- 2 tsp grated lime peel
- 7 garlic cloves, finely chopped (or smashed)
- ½ C chopped fresh cilantro (or 3 Tbsp dried)
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp ground red pepper
- ½ C olive oil
- ⅓ C soy sauce
- ¼ C tequila
- 2 2-lbs beef loin tri-tip roasts, trimmed

## Notes

I used flank steak, as well, marinated for 1 hour, was delicious. Only cooked for about 6 minutes, should've been about 10.

Skirt steak takes about 6 minutes, it's really thin.

I'm trying tri-tip at about 20 minutes on the theory it's about as thick as a London Broil on the thick side. Maybe thicker.

Use good tequila.
