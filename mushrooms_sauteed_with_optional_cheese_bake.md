# Mushrooms Sauteed with Optional Cheese Bake

## Ingredients

- 10 oz cremini (baby bella) mushrooms, sliced (1 package pre-sliced is perfect)
- 3 Tbsp butter
- 7 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ sweet white onion, chopped
- 3 Tbsp soy sauce
- If baking with cheese: 250g shredded cheese; 50/50 Cheddar/Gruyere recommended

## Instructions

If baking, preheat an oven to 400F, and use an oven-safe cast-iron or nonstick skillet for the following:

Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Melt butter in the skillet, then add the onions and sweat until translucent, about 7 minutes. Add the garlic, and cook until fragrent, about 30 seconds. Add the mushrooms and toss in the pan to coat with the remaining butter in the pan.

Continue heating, stirring occasionally until the mushrooms begin to release their water, about five minutes. Once the water is released, add the soy sauce, and increase heat to high until the water is completely boiled off, stirring the mushrooms occassionally.

Once the mushrooms have begun to dry out, stir frequently until they are browned. If not baking, serve immediately.

If baking, cover with shredded cheese, and place in the oven until cheese is melted. Optionally place under broiler for 2 - 3 minutes until cheese browns. Let cheese set up for five minutes before serving.
