1 lbs ground beef, any fat percentage
1 lbs ground bison or venison
28 oz canned chopped tomatoes
16 oz dried kidney beans
1 medium white onion, chopped
12 garlic cloves, minced
3 Tbsp chili powder
1 Hershey's chocolate bar
1 1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp msg
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1 1/2 tsp cayenne
1 can Guiness Beer
2C Beef Stock, Low Sodium

Brown the beef and game meat together in a skillet until the fat is
rendered. Drain the fat off and discard (or save for another use).

Then, dump everything in the slow cooker, cover, and cook on low for 8
hours.

Pairs excellently with [corn bread](cornbread.md).

Safety Note: Kidney beans have a toxic compound,
"phytohaemagglutinin," in them. It is removed by cooking them at over
212F for more than ten minutes. You will find dire warnings online
about **never** cooking kidney beans in a slow cooker because it does
not get hot enough to destory this chemical. My slow cooker even on
low boils for more than an hour at the end, and I've made this recipe
for more than ten years without incident. If you're concerned, you can
substitute black beans.

Soaking Note: Similary people will say you must soak the beans for
five hours, or overnight, and discard the water or else face
gastrointestinal issues. Again, I don't do this and have never had an
issue, but if you're sensitive, you may soak the beans before-hand and
discard the water, and then follow the recipe above unchanged.
