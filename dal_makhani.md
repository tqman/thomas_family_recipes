1 Curad dal (whole black gram lentils)
1/2 Crajma (kidney beans)
1 bay leaf
1 cinnamon stick
3-4 cardamom pods
3-4 cloves
1 Tbsp ginger, finely chopped
8 garlic cloves, finely chopped or minced
2 green chillies, slit lengthwise
1 Tbsp coriander powder
1/2 tsp turmeric powder
1/2 tsp red chilli powder
4 large tomatoes, diced
1 tsp garam masala powder
2 Tbsp butter (+ extra for serving)
Salt, to taste
1/4 C cream
1 tsp kasuri methi (dried fenugreek), optional

Soak both the lentils (urad dal/whole black gram and rajma/kidney
beans) in water overnight or at least for 6 hours. This needs to be
done only if you are using dry lentils.

Add all the ingredients to the slow cooker (except cream and kasuri
methi) along with four cups water. Stir well. Cook on high for 8 hours
or low for at least 12 hours till the lentils are cooked through and
can be easily smashed between your fingers.

Mix well and lightly mash everything with the back of a ladle or
spoon. Add the cream and kasuri methi if using and cook on low for
another 20 minutes. Top with more butter and serve hot. If serving
later, you can keep this on warm for up to 3 hours. Just thin with a
little water or milk before serving if it's too thick.
