1 9" frozen pie crust
1 Tbsp butter or olive oil
1 small yellow onion, finely diced or  ½ C thinly sliced shallots
4 eggs
1 C heavy cream
½ C whole milk
⅛ tsp freshly grated nutmeg
⅛ tsp cayenne
½ tsp salt
170 grams cheese, shredded coarsely. Recommend 70g Gruyere and 100g
cheddar.

Preheat oven to 400F.

Remove pie crust from the freezer and let defrost for ten minutes.

When soft enough, prick the crust all over with a fork, about 1"
between pricks.

Bake crust for 10 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 325F.

Prep whatever is needed for the filling (see below)

Heat olive oil or butter in a small skillet, and sweat the
onions/shallots until softened, about five minutes.

Remove from heat and let cool. Add to filling mix with ¼ tsp of
salt.

In a medium bowl, beat eggs well. Add cream, milk, ½ tsp salt,
nutmeg, and cayenne and mix until well combined.

Place the cheese on the bottom of the pie pan. Add the filling in an
even layer, and then pour the egg mixture over the top.

Bake until filling is just set and still slightly jiggly but not
sloshy in the center, 50-55 minutes.

Let cool for a minimum of ten minutes, ideally longer.



Fillings:

Florentine:
10 oz package frozen spinach
¼ tsp salt

Defrost the spinach in the microwave, in a lidded bowl. Drain in a
colander, pressing down on the spinach. Gather it into a ball and
squeeze until dry. The drier, the better.
