2 mangoes, peeled and chopped
2 avocados, peeled and chopped
2 tomatoes, chopped
2 Thai chilis, chopped
5 cloves garlic
Juice of 1 1/2 limes
1 tsp salt
2 tbsp (?) olive oil

Combine all the ingredients in a bowl. Can serve immediately, but is
improved by giving it at least two hours in the refrigerator for
flavors to combine.

Note: Might be improved with some red onion
