3 cloves garlic, chopped (or one scallion, chopped)
3 Tbsp butter, separated
1 sprig rosemary, chopped
1/2 C chicken broth
2 C apple juice
Salt and pepper to taste

Optional: squeeze of lemon juice to brighten (not needed if the pork
was cooked with lemon per Ad Hoc and you're using all the pan drippings
to start)

Traditional Pan Sauce Method:

After cooking the pork, remove it from the pan and set aside to rest,
covered with foil to keep warm.

Pour out all but a couple of tablespoons of fat from the pan.

Return the pan to medium heat. Add the garlic (or scallion) and sauté
until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Add the chicken broth and apple juice to the pan, scraping the bottom
with a wooden spoon to deglaze and incorporate all the browned bits.

Add the chopped rosemary. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to
medium-high and simmer briskly until the liquid has reduced by half and
thickened slightly, about 8-12 minutes.

Remove the pan from heat. Add 2 Tbsp of the butter and swirl the pan
until the butter is fully incorporated and the sauce is glossy.

Taste and season with salt and pepper. Add lemon juice if desired.

Serve immediately over sliced pork.

Modernist Version:

Follow the same steps as above through reducing the liquid.

After reducing, use an immersion blender to blend the sauce smooth.
While blending, add 1/4 tsp xanthan gum and blend until fully
incorporated.

Remove from heat, add the 2 Tbsp butter, and blend until incorporated.

Taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
