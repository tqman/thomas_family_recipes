# Spanish Rice

## Ingredients

- ½ diced sweet onion
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- ½ tsp cumin
- ½ tsp salt
- 3 Tbsp cilantro
- 3 garlic cloves, minced, pressed, or smashed
- ½ tsp cayenne pepper
- 2 C (420g) dried white rice
- 1 28oz can whole tomatoes
- Juice of one lime
- ¼ C olive oil
- ¼ C tequila

## Instructions

Drain the tomatoes, and puree them with stick blender. Put everything in the rice maker.

## Notes

20191006 - Current recipe above

20071110 - Did as below, but added 1.5 C of water, and cooked with 2 C of California Basmati Rice (also listed as 2:3 on the packaged) in the steamer.

### Experiment 20071103

I put in:

- 4 pureed tomatoes
- ½ pureed giant "Vidalia" (Peruvian actually) onion
- Juice of one lime
- 1 tsp oregano
- ½ tsp cumin
- ½ tsp salt
- ¼ C cilantro
- ¼ C olive oil
- ¼ C tequila
- 3 garlic cloves, chopped
- 1 tsp ground black pepper

I pureed all of that, which made about 2 C of liquid stuff.

Then I put 1½ C of that, with all the white rice I had (about 1 C of jasmine) in the steamer. The rice requested 2:3 rice:liquid ratio.

The result was a little undercooked all around, and burned on the bottom. Dunno if more rice and more liquid would've been better.

Betsy described it as "creamy" and "risotto" like and really liked it. A good addition in the future would be some sort of broth.
