1 pound ground pork
1 inch fresh ginger grated
1 clove garlic, pressed
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon Chinese 5 spice (optional)
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 1/2 cups packaged fresh coleslaw (or 2 1/2 cups finely chopped
  cabbage & shredded carrots)

12 egg roll wrappers (6 inch square)
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons water
1 quart neutral oil for frying

Over medium heat, cook pork, ginger, garlic, onion powder, chinese 5
spice (if using) and soy sauce until no pink remains.

Add the coleslaw (or cabbage and carrots) to the pork mixture and cook
for 2-3 minutes until the cabbage is slightly softened. Remove from
heat and allow the filling to cool to room temperature.

In a small bowl, mix together the flour and water to create a paste for
sealing the egg rolls.

To assemble the egg rolls: Place one wrapper on a clean surface with
one corner pointing toward you (diamond shape). Place about 2-3
tablespoons of filling in the center of the wrapper. Fold the bottom
corner over the filling, then fold in the left and right corners. Roll
tightly toward the top corner. Use the flour paste to seal the top
corner. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.

Heat the oil in a large, deep pot or wok to 350F (use a
thermometer to verify temperature).

Working in batches of 3-4 egg rolls at a time, carefully add the egg
rolls to the hot oil. Fry for 3-4 minutes, turning occasionally, until
golden brown and crispy on all sides.

Remove with a slotted spoon or spider and drain on paper towels. Allow
the oil to return to 350F between batches.

Serve hot with sweet and sour sauce, duck sauce, or soy sauce for
dipping.
