1/4 cup (57 g) mascarpone
1/4 cup heavy cream
2 teaspoons honey, divided
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
Two (2-inch) gingersnap cookies (1/2 ounce total)
3 ripe peaches, any size, halved and pitted
1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as avocado or canola

In a large bowl, combine the mascarpone, cream, 1 teaspoon of the honey
and the vanilla. Using a hand mixer on medium-high speed, whip the
mixture until soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. You should have about
3/4 cup, more than twice than the amount needed for this recipe.

Place the gingersnaps in a small zip-top bag, and use a rolling pin or
mallet to crush them into medium-fine crumbs. Brush the cut side of
each peach with the oil.

Heat the grill and place the peaches on the grill, oil side down, and
cook until they soften slightly and grill marks form on the bottom,
about 2 minutes.

Transfer to a serving dish, and let cool slightly or completely. When
ready to serve, dollop about 2 teaspoons of the mascarpone whip into
the well of each peach half. Drizzle with the remaining 1 teaspoon of
honey, sprinkle with the crushed gingersnaps and serve.
