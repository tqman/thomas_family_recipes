Convo with Nathan: Add some sage since you prolly have it anyway?

1 12 (14?) oz bag frozen pearl onions
1 Clow-sodium chicken broth
1/4 Cdry sherry
1 tspminced fresh thyme
1 bay leaf
1 1/2 tspcornstarch
1 Cwhole milk
1 Cheavy cream
Salt and pepper
1/4 C minced fresh chives
2 tsplemon juice
Fresh nutmeg

Bring onions, broth, sherry, thyme, and bay leaf to boil in 12+ inch
nonstick skillet or cast-iron pan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium
and simmer until liquid evaporates, 12 to 15 minutes.

Whisk cornstarch and 1 Tbps milk together in small bowl until
combined. Stir cream, remaining milk, cornstarch mixture, 1 tsp salt,
and 1/2 tsp pepper into the onions and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to
medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened and
onions are tender when pierced with tip of a paring knife, 8 - 10 minutes.

Off heat, stir in 2 Tbspns chives, lemon juice, and grate nutmeg over the
top. Remove bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to
serving bowl. Sprinkle with remaining 2 Tbspns chives. Serve immediately.

These may be kept edible a bit longer by putting them on the "warm"
setting of a crockpot.
