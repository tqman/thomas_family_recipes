# Tandoori Chicken

## Ingredients

- 4 lbs chicken breast, cut into 2-inch chunks
- 2 tablespoons toasted ground cumin
- 2 tablespoons toasted paprika
- 1 tablespoon toasted ground coriander seeds
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 tablespoon achiote or a few drops red food coloring (optional)
- 8 cloves garlic, grated on a microplane grater
- 2 tablespoons fresh ginger, grated on a microplane grater
- 2 cups yogurt
- 1/2 cup lemon juice
- 1/4 cup kosher salt
- Thinly sliced raw onion, for serving
- 1/2 cup roughly chopped cilantro leaves, for serving
- 2 lemons or limes, cut into wedges, for serving

## Instructions

Combine the cumin, paprika, coriander, turmeric, cayenne, achiote (if using), garlic, ginger, yogurt, lemon juice, and salt in a large bowl. Mix well.

Cut chicken breast into 2-inch chunks. Add to the marinade and toss to coat thoroughly.

Cover and refrigerate for 4-8 hours.

When ready to cook, thread the chicken chunks onto skewers.

Prepare a charcoal grill for direct high heat. Grill the chicken skewers, turning occasionally, until cooked through and lightly charred, about 10-15 minutes total.

Serve with sliced raw onion, cilantro, and lemon or lime wedges.

## Notes

Original recipe calls for Cornish game hens (about 1 1/2 pounds each), butterflied and skewered whole.
