# Teriyaki Sauce

## Ingredients

- ⅓ C light soy sauce (20090328: Tried ¼ C regular soy sauce)
- ⅔ C sake
- 5 cloves garlic, smashed
- 2 inches of fresh ginger, sliced thin, or 1 tsp dried
- Juice of ½ lemon
- ½ C mirin (subst: ½ C sake + ⅓ C sugar (or ¼ C agave syrup))
- 1 Tbsp cornstarch

## Instructions

Mix together the soy sauce, ⅔ C sake, garlic, ginger and lemon juice in a small saucepan. If substituting for mirin, add the sugar as well and reserve the ½ C sake; otherwise, just reserve the mirin.

Simmer for 5 minutes.

While simmering, mix the cornstarch with the ½ C of mirin or sake.

When mixture is done simmering, strain the solid parts out, then return to heat, and return to a low boil. Add cornstarch, and simmer until thick. Ideally, cool before using (20 min in freezer should bring it to room temperature).

For a "sweet and sour" sauce, hold lemon juice, double it, and add it after straining.

## Notes

20090328: The substitutions below (regular soy sauce and mirin) seemed good. I actually put in maybe double the ginger (4 tsp), and simmered it for about two more minutes (7, total). It had a nice little spicy undertone.
