# Carolina BBQ

There are four things that need to happen in this process. There are a number of options on how to proceed with them. Those four things are:

1. Make BBQ Sauce
2. Make Slaw
3. Cook the pork
4. Smoke the pork (may be done at the same time as #3)

## BBQ Sauce

This is a "Piedmont" or "Lexington" sauce. It is very thin, vinegary, and has a little of tomato in it for color and flavor (from ketchup). This yields about two cups, which is enough to make the slaw later in this recipe, and to use as the liquid in a pressure cooker if you're making it this way. You may wish to double up the sauce recipe so you have more to put on the finished product; it keeps basically forever since it's mostly vinegar.

### Ingredients

- 1-1/2 C distilled white or cider vinegar 320 g (I prefer cider)
- 10 Tbsp (200g) tomato ketchup
- Salt to taste, if desired
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- Pinch of crushed hot red pepper flakes
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1/2 C water
- Freshly ground pepper to taste

### Instructions

Put everything in a pot and bring it briefly to a boil and stir to combine. If you want to get fancy, you could hit it with a stick blender to dissolve all the ketchup solids. Let cool.

## Slaw

This is *not* Cole slaw, which has things like mayonnaise and raisins in it. It's just slaw, or maybe "red slaw" or "BBQ slaw" if you want to get all specific.

### Ingredients

- 1 lbs shredded cabbage
- 1 C BBQ Sauce, above

### Instructions

Stir to combine, chill. Better if made a day or more in advance to let the flavors combine.

## Cooking the Pork

There are four basic options here for how to do it. The first is the hardest: Get a real smoker, rub the pork with salt, hickory smoke it for at least 18 hours. If you don't know how to do that, I'm not going to explain it here.

The second way is sous vide: Cook the pork at 160F for 18 - 72 (!) hours, then see smoking instructions, below. If you have the ability to salt it before you sous vide it, that's great, and you should. Otherwise, you'll need to liberally salt the final result. (You may not be able to do this because if you're making a full 7 lbs shoulder, you probably can't re-vacuum seal it before you cook it).

The third way is pressure cooking it. In this case, get a boneless half-shoulder (2.25 - 3.5 lbs generally). Rub it with salt. Place 1C of the BBQ SAUCE in the pressure cooker, then the shoulder, fat side up (if you do it the other way around, you'll wash all the salt off). Cook it on high pressure for 80 minutes, and then allow for a natural pressure release (generally about 25 more minutes).

The final way is to cook it in an oven. You want to bring it to an internal temperature of 160F and hold it there for a long time (18 hours). If your oven goes down to 170, you could probably put it in the oven for 18 hours. I've never tried it and you should use a thermometer to ensure you hit the target temperature.

## Smoking the Pork

If you cooked the pork by smoking it, you've already done this part. If you used sous vide, pressure cooking, or oven:

You should hickory smoke the pork for at least an hour, ideally two. You can do this on a Weber or other similar charcoal grill with a lid either by placing hickory chips on hot coals (no need to wet them) with the vents mostly closed, or by burning hickory chunk wood (NOT charcoal). The pork will turn brown, and get almost black if you leave it long enough. Generally you'll want to poke the fire / replenish chips about once every half hour or so to keep the smoke active.

If you don't have a fire available to you, you could *try* adding some liquid smoke flavor to the shredded pork. But, I find the hickory smoke flavor to be so essential to this, I've never tried it, and no promises. Good luck, though!

## Shredding the Pork

At this point the pork should be very tender. Take it to a cutting board, get two forks, and just pull the pork apart until you have a bunch of shreds of pork. There will be a little bit of inedible gristle and hunks of fat; just throw those away.

Add additional salt and pepper to taste if desired, and you may wish to put some more BBQ sauce on the result.

Serve with the slaw. You can eat this straight off a plate, it's also popular to serve it on hamburger buns, with the slaw on top of the meat (my preference). I also like to serve it with homemade [cornbread](cornbread.md) and [baked beans](baked_beans.md).
