## Making Pizza (Traditional Method)

### Timeline

- **T-2:20** Remove dough from the fridge. Flour the work surface, press dough balls into disks about ½ inch thick and 5 inches in diameter. Cover with wet towels, and leave be.

- **T-1:20** Start oven at maximum (550 in my case), with a pizza stone on the bottom rack, one notch from the very bottom.

- **T-0:40** Begin making the sauce, and let simmer.

- **T-0:20** Take the sauce off the heat, and begin forming the dough into a pizza shell. Dust a pizza peel generously with cornmeal, and place the shell upon it. Top it with sauce, mozzarella, and whatever else.

- **T-0:10** Place pizza on the stone.

Depending on how hot the oven and stone are, the pizza should be done in approximately six - seven minutes. Let rest for at least four minutes when it is removed so that the cheese can set up a bit.

After about an hour (maybe a little more), the pizza stone should be heated.

- 1 can pureed tomatoes (no salt added)
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 2 large garlic cloves, minced
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tsp sugar

### Instructions

Heat a medium saucepan. Add oil, and then garlic. Cook the garlic about 40 seconds, then add tomatoes and sugar. Simmer uncovered until the sauce thickens enough to coat a wooden spoon (about 15 minutes).

Season with salt and pepper to taste.

## Pizza Dough (2009 Version)

Adapted from http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/001199.html

### Ingredients
- 4½ C flour (Italian 00 pizza flour; bread flour or all-purpose, in preferred order)
- 1¾ tsp salt
- 1 tsp instant yeast
- ¼ C olive oil (optional - crust will be crispier and more authentic without)
- 1¾ C (14 oz) water, ice cold (40F)

### Instructions

Put flour, salt, yeast and olive oil in bread machine. Knead for 30 minutes, do not let the "rise" cycle happen. Or, if kneading by hand, combine ingredients, and knead by hand for about ten minutes. The dough should be very soft at the end.

Dust the counter with flour, and divide the dough in half. Form each piece into a ball. Coat hands in olive oil, rub each ball in same, and place in a ziplock bag. Refrigerate the bag overnight. Each ball makes 3 - 4 pizza crusts (depending on the desired size of the resulting pizza), and may be used within 4 days, or frozen.

To use frozen dough, move it to the fridge from the freezer the day before.

On pizza day, remove the dough from refrigerator 2 hours before you want to cook the pizza. Flour a workspace and divide the big ball into smaller balls (one per pizza). Press the dough balls into disks about ½ inch thick. Cover these disks - either with a moist, lint-free towel, or plastic wrap. If plastic wrapping, it's advisable to dust the tops of the disk with a little flour, first. Let rest for two hours.

One hour before you put the pizza in the oven, place the stone in the oven, and preheat to its hottest setting (usually 550).

Dust the pizza peel (a pizza pan or a piece of cardboard may be substituted for a pizza peel) with flour, cornmeal or semolina. Flour and semolina are more authentic Italian; cornmeal gives a nice crunch to the crust.

Flour your hands (including the backs), and drape the dough over your knuckles. Stretch it out into a pizza shape, and lie it on the peel. Place sauce, cheese, and toppings on it. Shake the peel back an forth to ensure the dough isn't stuck to it, then carefully slide it onto the hot baking stone.

The pizza will generally take 5 - 6 minutes to cook. To remove it, decisively slide the peel under the pizza, then lift it out. Let cool for 3-5 minutes before slicing to let the cheese set.

## Original Recipe from 101 Cookbooks

http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/001199.html

### Ingredients
- 4½ C (20.25 oz) unbleached high-gluten, bread, or all-purpose flour, chilled
- 1¾ (.44 oz) tsp salt
- 1 tsp (.11 oz) instant yeast
- ¼ C (2 oz) olive oil (optional)
- 1¾ C (14 oz) water, ice cold (40 F)
- Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

### Instructions

1. Stir together the flour, salt, and instant yeast in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). With a large metal spoon, stir in the oil and the cold water until the flour is all absorbed (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment), If you are mixing by hand, repeatedly dip one of your hands or the metal spoon into cold water and use it, much like a dough hook, to work the dough vigorously into a smooth mass while rotating the bowl in a circular motion with the other hand. Reverse the circular motion a few times to develop the gluten further. Do this for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed. If you are using an electric mixer, switch to the dough hook and mix on medium speed for 5 to 7 minutes, or as long as it takes to create a smooth, sticky dough. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. If the dough is too wet and doesn't come off the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in some more flour just until it clears the sides. If it clears the bottom of the bowl, dribble in a tea- spoon or two of cold water. The finished dough will be springy, elastic, and sticky, not just tacky, and register 50 to 55F.

2. Sprinkle flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter. Prepare a sheet pan by lining it with baking parchment and misting the parchment with spray oil (or lightly oil the parchment). Using a metal dough scraper, cut the dough into 6 equal pieces (or larger if you are comfortable shaping large pizzas), You can dip the scraper into the water between cuts to keep the dough from sticking to it, Sprinkle flour over the dough. Make sure your hands are dry and then flour them. Lift each piece and gently round it into a ball. If the dough sticks to your hands, dip your hands into the flour again. Transfer the dough balls to the sheet pan, Mist the dough generously with spray oil and slip the pan into a food-grade plastic bag.

3. Put the pan into the refrigerator overnight to rest the dough, or keep for up to 3 days. (Note: If you want to save some of the dough for future baking, you can store the dough balls in a zippered freezer bag. Dip each dough ball into a bowl that has a few tablespoons of oil in it, rolling the dough in the oil, and then put each ball into a separate bag. You can place the bags into the freezer for up to 3 months. Transfer them to the refrigerator the day before you plan to make pizza.)

4. On the day you plan to make the pizza, remove the desired number of dough balls from the refrigerator 2 hours before making the pizza. Dust the counter with flour, and then mist the counter with spray oil. Place the dough balls on top of the floured counter and sprinkle them with flour; dust your hands with flour. Gently press the dough into flat disks about 1/2 inch thick and 5 inches in diameter. Sprinkle the dough with flour, mist it again with spray oil, and cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag. Let rest for 2 hours.

5. At least 45 minutes before making the pizza, place a baking stone either on the floor of the oven (for gas ovens), or on a rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven as hot as possible, up to 800F (most home ovens will go only to 500 to 550F, but some will go higher). If you do not have a baking stone, you can use the back of a sheet pan, but do not preheat the pan.

6. Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan with semolina flour or cornmeal. Make the pizzas one at a time. Dip your hands, including the backs of your hands and knuckles, in flour and lift I piece of dough by getting under it with a pastry scraper. Very gently lay the dough across your fists and carefully stretch it by bouncing the dough in a circular motion on your hands, carefully giving it a little stretch with each bounce. If it begins to stick to your hands, lay it down on the floured counter and reflour your hands, then continue shaping it. Once the dough has expanded outward, move to a full toss as shown on page 208. If you have trouble tossing the dough, or if the dough keeps springing back, let it rest for 5 to 20 minutes so the gluten can relax, and try again. You can also resort to using a rolling pin, though this isn't as effective as the toss method.

7. When the dough is stretched out to your satisfaction (about 9 to 12 inches in diameter for a 6-ounce piece of dough), lay it on the peel or pan, making sure there is enough semolina flour or cornmeal to allow it to slide. Lightly top it with sauce and then with your other top- pings, remembering that the best pizzas are topped with a less-is-more philosophy. The American "kitchen sink" approach is counterproductive, as it makes the crust more difficult to bake. A few, usually no more than 3 or 4 toppings, including sauce and cheese is sufficient.

8. Slide the topped pizza onto the stone (or bake directly on the sheet pan) and close the door. Wait 2 minutes, then take a peek. If it needs to be rotated 180 degrees for even baking, do so. The pizza should take about 5 to 8 minutes to bake. If the top gets done before the bottom, you will need to move the stone to a lower self before the next round. if the bottom crisps before the cheese caramelizes, then you will need to raise the stone for subsequent bakes.

9. Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Wait 3 to 5 minutes before slicing and serving, to allow the cheese to set slightly.
