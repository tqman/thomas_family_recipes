20090328:  The substitutions below (regular soy sauce and mirin)
seemed good.  I actually put in maybe double the ginger (4 tsp), and
simmered it for about two more minutes (7, total).  It had a nice
little spicy undertone.


1/3 cup light soy sauce (20090328:  Tried 1/4 C regular soy sauce)
2/3 cup sake
5 cloves garlic, smashed
2 inches of fresh ginger, sliced thin, or 1 tsp dried
Juice of 1/2 lemon

1/2 cup mirin (subst: 1/2 cup sake + 1/3 cup sugar (or 1/4 C agave syrup))
1 Tbsp cornstarch




Mix together the soy sauce, 2/3 C sake, sugar, garlic, ginger and lemon
juice in a small saucepan.  Reserve the mirin. Simmer for 5 minutes.


While simmering, mix the cornstarch with the 1/2 cup of mirin


When mixture is done simmering, strain the solid parts out, then
return to heat, and return to a low boil.  Add cornstarch, and simmer
until thick.  Ideally, cool before using (20 min in freezer should
bring it to room temperature).






For a "sweet and sour" sauce, hold lemon juice, double it, and add it
after straining.
