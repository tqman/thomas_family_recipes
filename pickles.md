# Pickles

Makes one jar worth of brine.

## Ingredients

- Cucumbers (enough to fill jars - about 1-1.5 lbs per quart jar)
- Mason jars with lids

### Brine:

- 1C Water
- 1C Vinegar (apple cider vinegar recommended)
- 1½ Tbsp salt
- ½ tsp sugar

### Per pickle jar:

- 12 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
- ½ habeñero pepper
- 1 tsp dill seeds
- 1 tsp mustard seeds
- 1 tsp peppercorns
- 2 sprigs fresh dill

## Instructions

Wash and dry the jars and lids.

Wash, dry, and trim the cucumbers. You can leave the cucumbers whole, cut them lengthwise into spears, or slice them crosswise into coins.

Peel and smash the garlic cloves. Place the smashed garlic cloves, habeñero, dill seeds, mustard seeds, peppercorns, and fresh dill in the jars.

Pack the cucumbers (vertically if they are whole or cut in spears) into the jars. Trim the ends if they stand more than 1/2 inch below the top of the jar.

Place the apple cider vinegar, water, salt, and sugar in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Pour the brine over the pickles, filling each jar to within 1/2-inch of the top.

Gently tap the jars against the counter a few times to remove all the air bubbles. Top off with more pickling brine if needed.

Place the lids over the jars and screw on the rings until tight (but not too tight).

Let the jars cool to room temperature, then refrigerate. The pickles will improve with flavor as they age — try to wait at least 48 hours before cracking them open.
