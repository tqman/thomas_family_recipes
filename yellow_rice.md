# Yellow Rice

## Ingredients

- 1 C (215g) white rice (N.B.! This is one ACTUAL cup, not rice-cooker cup, see liquid below)
- ½ medium onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped (or smashed if you're lazy like me)
- 2 Tbsp butter
- ½ tsp turmeric
- ½ tsp cumin
- ½ tsp salt
- 2C (500g) of chicken stock

## Instructions

If you're feeling particular, rinse the rice first; if you don't, it'll brown a bit on the bottom.

Dump everything in the rice cooker and cook it on normal rice setting.
