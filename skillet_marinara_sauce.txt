1 28-ounce can whole San Marzano tomatoes, certified D.O.P. if possible
7 garlic cloves, peeled and minced or pressed
Small dried whole chile, or pinch crushed red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 large fresh basil sprig, or 1/4 tsp dried
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano, more to taste
1 C water

If making pizza sauce: 2 Tbsp sugar

Put tomatoes in a large bowl and crush with your hands. Add 1 C water
to tomato can and swirl around to get remaining juices, and add to
crushed tomatoes.

Heat olive oil in a large stainless steel skillet (not pot) over medium
heat. Add garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Add all other ingredients. Simmer sauce until thickened and surface oil
is a deep orange, about 25 minutes.

Optional enhancement: Prior to adding the garlic to the hot oil,
instead add 1/4 C of tomato paste, and cook for 7 minutes, until brown
and sticking to the pan (this only works on something not nonstick, like
stainless steel). Then, add the garlic as above, but, when you add the
tomato and water to the skillet, scrape the bottom with a wooden spoon
to release the fond. This adds a lot of depth of flavor to the sauce,
but isn't strictly necessary.
