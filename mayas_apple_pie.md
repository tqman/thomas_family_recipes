This recipe assumes you have already made Claire Saffitz' Pie Dough
and it is resting in the fridge, but not rolled out.

Ingredients:
2½ lbs granny smith apples
2½ lbs opal apples
150g (¾ C) sugar
15g (2 Tbsp) cornstarch
¾ tsp ground cinnamon
2 tsp fresh juice and 1 tsp grated zest from 1 lemon
1 large egg
1 Tbsp Turbinado sugar

Notes:
Opal apples are there for flavor and as a less tart apple to compliment
the Granny Smith. Golden Delicious or Braeburn apples are good other options.

Turbinado sugar is for sprinkling, and can be replaced with Demarara
sugar or normal table sugar if not available.


Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and place a heavy rimmed baking
sheet on it.  Toss apple slices with sugar,
cornstarch, cinnamon, and lemon juice and zest until well coated. Let
rest for 10 minutes.

Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).

Transfer apples and their juices to a large Dutch oven. Heat over low heat,
stirring constantly, until lightly steaming. Cover and continue cooking over
lowest heat setting, stirring frequently, using a thermometer to maintain
temperature below 160°F (71°C). Do not allow liquid to come to a boil for
first 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, increase heat to medium-high and cook,
stirring frequently, until juices thicken enough that a spatula dragged
through the bottom of the pot leaves a trail that very slowly closes back up,
about 15 minutes more. Transfer apples to a rimmed baking sheet, spread out
into a single layer, and allow to cool completely, about 1 hour.

Let the pie dough sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes to soften
slightly, then beat it across the surface with a rolling pin to make it
more pliable. Separate the pie dough into two pieces, one making up roughly
60% of the dough and the other 40%. Dust the top and underside of the larger
half with flour, then roll it out, dusting with more flour as needed, into
a 13-inch round that's about ⅛-inch thick. Roll the pastry onto the rolling
pin.

Unroll the round onto a 9-inch pie plate, preferably glass, letting the pastry
slump gently down the sides into the bottom. If the pastry does not rest on
the bottom of the plate, press it gently to the base while bringing the edge
of the round closer to the center to ease the slack. Firmly press the pastry
into the bottom and up the sides of the plate, ensuring contact everywhere and
making sure not to stretch it.

Transfer the filling into the pie shell, evening the surface with a spatula once
it all is added.

Flatten the smaller half of the pie dough using the same process as the first.
It will have a high tendency to stick, so dust flour on the top and bottom
liberally when rolling it out. This round should be roughly 11 inches in
diameter, enough to lay over the top of the pie plate with an inch of overhang
on all sides. Roll the pastry onto the rolling pin.

Using kitchen shears, trim both of the pie crusts together around the edge of
the pastry, leaving a ½-inch overhang. Discard the scraps.

Tuck the overhang underneath itself all the way around so you have a lip of
double-thick pastry resting just around the rim of the pie plate.

Press down firmly around the rim to seal, then crimp the crust all the way around,
using the thumb of one hand and the thumb and forefinger of the other, flouring
your fingers if needed to prevent sticking.

Cut 5 slits in the top with a sharp knife for ventilation. 

Use a pastry brush to brush an even coat of a lightly beaten egg all over the top
surface of the pie. Sprinkle evenly with 1 Tbsp (15g) of Turbinado sugar.
Transfer pie to baking sheet in oven and bake until light golden brown, about 
0 minutes. Reduce heat to 375°F (190°C) and continue baking until deep golden
brown, about 25 minutes longer. Remove from oven and allow to cool at room
temperature for at least 4 hours before serving.
