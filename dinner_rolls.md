# Dinner Rolls

## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast
- 1 C milk
- 1 Tbsp vinegar
- 2 Tbsp honey
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
- 410 grams (3 C) bread flour
- 3 Tbsp butter, melted

## Instructions

Heat milk to 110 degrees F (1:10 in my microwave out of the fridge). Mix yeast into milk and let sit for ten minutes.

While that activates, put all the other ingredients (vinegar, honey, salt, butter and flour) into the mixing bowl.

When the yeast is active, add to the mixing bowl and mix for three minutes with the bread hook. Let rest five minutes, and then mix for three more minutes with the bread hook.

Place the dough ball in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm spot until the dough has doubled in size, usually about 90 minutes.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 12 pieces. Roll the pieces into balls and place them on a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone sheet on it. Allow the rolls to rise another 20 minutes.

Brush the rolls with melted butter and bake at 400 degrees until golden brown (about 20 minutes).

## Notes

20191202 - These are so dense they made my mixer smoke. Find a lighter recipe?

20120303 - Stuck to bottom of mixing bowl last time I made it; trying increasing flour by 20G to 410 G.
