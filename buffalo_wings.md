# Buffalo Wings (Oven-Fried)

The baking powder + overnight dry is the trick here. Makes baked wings that are nearly indistinguishable from deep-fried, without the oil mess.

Per pound of chicken wings:

## Ingredients

### Wings

- 1 lb chicken wings, cut into drumettes and flats
- 2 tsp (10g) baking powder (aluminum-free, or you'll get a metallic taste)
- 2 tsp (10g) kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use same weight but half volume for Morton's)

### Sauce

- 4 Tbsp unsalted butter (must be unsalted or the sauce is way too salty)
- 4 Tbsp Frank's RedHot

### Serving

- Blue cheese dressing
- Celery sticks

## Instructions

Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack inside. Dry the wings thoroughly with paper towels. Toss wings with the baking powder and salt until evenly coated. Place on the rack with a little space between each wing.

Refrigerate uncovered for at least 8 hours, up to 24. This dries the skin out and is what makes them crispy.

Preheat oven to 450°F with the rack in the upper-middle position. Bake for 20 minutes, flip, then continue cooking 15-30 minutes more until crisp and golden brown. Flip a few more times toward the end.

While wings finish, melt butter with hot sauce in a small saucepan over medium heat, whisking until combined.

Toss wings in the sauce. Serve with blue cheese and celery.

## Notes

Scale everything linearly — the recipe is given per pound so you can make as much as you want. 1-4 pounds works well on a single sheet pan.

If the wings aren't crisping up: make sure you dried them well before the baking powder, and make sure they got the full fridge time. Also check your oven temp with a thermometer.

If they're smoking, drain the fat from the tray partway through.
