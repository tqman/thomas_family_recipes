# Brownies

Made again at Elm St., took about 1:20. I think the temperature wants to be 350, I'm changing that.

First time I made this, in the Sunset Drive oven, 45 minutes was insufficient. The butter melting takes 1:30, then let it sit a bit

45 minutes was way too short in a white pan. Checked at 50 and it was still very wet. Next time try 60 before you open it.

## Ingredients

- Soft butter, for greasing the pan
- Flour, for dusting the buttered pan
- 4 large eggs
- 1 C (201 g) sugar, sifted
- 1 C (220 g) brown sugar, sifted
- 8 oz melted butter
- 1 1/4 C (55 g) cocoa, sifted
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 C (60 g) flour, sifted
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt

## Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour an 8-inch square pan. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the eggs at medium speed until fluffy and light yellow. Add both sugars. Add remaining ingredients, and mix to combine.

Pour the batter into a greased and floured 8-inch square pan and bake for 45 minutes. Check for doneness with the tried-and-true toothpick method: a toothpick inserted into the center of the pan should come out clean. When it's done, remove to a rack to cool. Resist the temptation to cut into it until it's mostly cool.
