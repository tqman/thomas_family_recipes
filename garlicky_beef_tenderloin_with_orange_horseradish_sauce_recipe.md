# Garlicky Beef Tenderloin With Orange Horseradish Sauce

## Ingredients

- 1 4-lbs beef tenderloin
- 1 Tbsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp chopped fresh rosemary
- 1 fat garlic clove, coarsely chopped
- 2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 C crème fraîche
- 1/4 C white horseradish
- Grated zest of half an orange

## Instructions

Season the tenderloin all over with the salt, pepper, rosemary and garlic. Cover the meat and refrigerate for at least two hours and preferably overnight. Let it come to room temperature for 1 hour before roasting

Heat oven to 450 degrees. Wipe off as much garlic as possible. (It tends to burn.)

In a large, ovenproof skillet over high heat, heat the oil. Add the meat and thoroughly brown all over, 4 to 5 minutes per side. (If your skillet isn't large enough, cut the meat in half.)

Place the skillet on the oven's middle rack and roast until an instant-read thermometer shows 120 degrees (for rare), 10 to 20 minutes. Let the meat rest for 10 minutes before carving.

In a small bowl, whisk the crème fraîche, horseradish and orange zest. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve alongside the tenderloin.
