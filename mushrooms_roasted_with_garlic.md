2 lbs (900g) cremini (baby bella) mushrooms, washed, trimmed, and quartered
½ C (1 stick) butter, divided into two half-sticks and melted (keep
separate)
7 cloves garlic, minced
2 tsp fresh thyme, chopped
¼ C soy sauce

Preheat oven to 375F. Toss mushrooms with ¼C melted butter, and
transfer to a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, spread into an even
layer.

Roast until mushrooms release liquid, about 15 minutes. Drain liquid
(you may save for another use; it's a mushroom-flavored umami source,
or discard).

While the mushrooms are roasting, mix together the remaining ¼C of
butter, garlic, thyme, and soy sauce. After draining, toss the
mushrooms in this sauce, and return to the foil-lined rimmed baking
sheet, and roast until browned but still tender, about 30 minutes.

Serve immediately.
