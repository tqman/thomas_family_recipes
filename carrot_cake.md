# Carrot Cake

## Ingredients

### Cake

- 1 1/2 C vegetable oil
- 2 C sugar
- 4 eggs
- 300g all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp baking soda
- 2 tsp cinnamon
- 215g (3 C) grated carrots

### Icing (double this for two layer cake)

- 8 oz cream cheese
- 1 stick butter (if unsalted, add 1/4 tsp salt)
- 16 oz (454g) powdered sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F. Take the cream cheese and butter out of the refrigerator and set on the counter to raise to room temperature.

Place oil, sugar, and eggs into the bowl of a mixer, mix on medium until the eggs are completely beaten. Add to this the flour, soda, and cinnamon. Mix on low to just combine. Add carrots and mix for just a few seconds to combine.

Cut rounds of parchment paper and line two 8 inch cake pans with them.

Bake in two 8 inch greased cake pans for 45 minutes - 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.

Remove from oven and allow to cool completely before removing from pans. Once cool, transfer to cake plate and ice.

While the cake is cooling, to make the frosting:

In the bowl of a mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and cream cheese on medium high until smooth and creamy. Add the confectioner's sugar, vanilla, and salt (if needed). Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then switch to medium high and beat for two minutes.

## Notes

Original from my brother Nathan, who got it from Grandmom Ginny.

My brother Brett always had this carrot cake on his birthday. When I found the recipe card Brett had actually written his name on it, clearly at a very young age. Personally I would be happy with just the cream cheese icing and a spoon.
