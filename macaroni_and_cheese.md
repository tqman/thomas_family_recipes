# Macaroni and Cheese

## Ingredients

### Modernist version

- 265g water
- 11g sodium citrate
- 285g shredded cheese - favorite: 214 g Cheddar 71 g Gruyere
- 240g dry pasta - any will probably do, but small noodles will be best. Macaroni is obviously traditional, but I prefer Cavatappi for a little extra fanciness.

### Traditional version

- 32 oz Macaroni
- 1½ lbs (24 oz) grated cheddar
- 8 oz grated jack cheese
- 16 oz sour cream
- 12 cloves garlic
- 2 pieces of bread, toasted, buttered and crumbed

## Instructions

### Modernist version

Cook the pasta according to its instructions, and drain. While the water is boiling and you're cooking the pasta, make the cheese sauce as follows:

Add the water to a small saucepan, and bring it to a simmer. Add the sodium citrate, and use an immersion blender to mix it with the water. Then, add cheese a handful at a time, blending with an immersion blender until smooth with each handful. After all cheese is added, bring to a light simmer for five minutes.

Place the pasta in a casserole dish, pour the cheese sauce over it, and toss to combine.

Can be made ahead and reheated in an oven (probably 350F for 15 minutes or so). May be topped with bread crumbs; if so, wait until you're reheating it, and regardless, toast it under a broiler until they're golden brown.

### Traditional version

Begin to cook the macaroni, and then continue on the other tasks. If it finishes, simply drain it, toss in a little butter (to lubricate it), toss it, and set it aside in a casserole dish or dishes.

Grate all the cheese.

Chop the garlic. Saute the garlic in butter, set aside.

Put one of the sour cream containers in a saucepan, over the lowest heat possible. Once it warms up, slowly begin adding the grated cheese. Keep it moving in the pan to keep it from burning to the bottom of the pan. As it thickens up, add the second tub of sour cream. When all the cheese is melted, pour it over the macaroni.

Toast 2 slices of bread. Fit them into the handy chopper and chop 'em to make 1C of bread crumbs, and spread over about half the mac and cheese. If you're doing all bread crumbs, use 4 pieces.

Place casseroles in the oven and broil for 10 minutes or until the top is just beginning to brown.

## Notes

### 20121226 note

This is way too much for four people (especially two of them picky). Halve it next year, maybe only make a third.

### Notes, 12/26/06

Above recipe was written 12/25/05.

I've updated the garlic to "6 cloves". We might've used a little more, but that was perfect. I put all the above-breadcrumbs on the little casserole (by mistake) and it was too much. I think probably half the above amount, and just put it on one casserole.

The above-described sour cream:cheese ratio was a bit large. Also, I think the pasta:sauce ratio was small. Next year I'm thinking only one package of sour cream, and 32oz of pasta.

Also, it took more like 35 minutes at 350 to brown it.

### Notes, 12/25/07

The '06 notes are all spot on - did 16oz of sour cream, and 2 pieces of toast for breadcrumbs. Big change this year was broiler browning - took less than 10 minutes in the oven.

Next year, should half the recipe if we only get the Sohns for dinner. Used exactly 2 lbs of cheese and 2lbs of macaroni, which was the exact right mixture. Probably could've used more garlic. Also, saved a pan by browning the garlic in the bottom of the saucepan before beginning.

I've updated the above recipe to these notes; it is probably "final".
