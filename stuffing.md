1 (7.5 oz) package dry cornbread mix
1 C butter
2 onions, chopped
6 stalks celery, chopped
1 lbs pork sausage
16 slices white bread
2 tsp dried sage
1 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp poultry seasoning
1 tsp salt
½ tsp ground black pepper
½ C chopped fresh parsley
2 eggs
4C chicken stock

Prepare corn bread as directed on package. Cool, and crumble.

Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook onions, and celery
in butter until tender, but not brown. In another pan, cook sausage over
medium-high heat until evenly browned.

Place corn bread and bread slices in a food processor. Pulse until they
turn into a crumbly mixture. Transfer mixture to a large bowl. Season
with sage, thyme, poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper. Mix in chopped
parsley, cooked vegetables, and sausage with drippings. Stir in eggs
and chicken stock. This mixture should be a bit mushy. Transfer to a
greased 9x13 inch pan.

Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 1 hour.
