6 ounces oatmeal stout, such as Schlafly’s
1 ounce maple syrup
1 whole egg
1 1/2 oz brandy

Pour six ounces of beer into a saucepan, then heat on the stove until
it starts to bubble. Do not let it boil.

While beer is heating, whisk together syrup, egg, and brandy in a
heat-safe mixing bowl.

After beer is fully heated, slowly pour the hot beer into the
spirit-sugar-egg mixture, stirring continually as you pour in order to
integrate the hot beer without cooking the egg.

Finally, rapidly pour the mixture back and forth between your mixing
bowl and your saucepan. You’ll need to do this four or five times. The
goal is to aerate the drink and froth the mixture. Some splashing is
to be expected. You should probably do this over a sink.

Christmas, 2020: Made with Anchor Steam Holiday Ale and Dark Rum, with
fresh nutmeg grated over the top. Was very good but a little bitter,
interested to try it with oatmeal stout
