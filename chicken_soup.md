# Chicken Soup

## Ingredients

### Soup

- 1 lbs carrots, peeled and sliced
- 2 stalks celery, chopped
- 2 onions, chopped
- 7 cloves garlic, minced
- Stock from [chicken_stock.md](chicken_stock.md)
- Leftover chicken from carcass
- 1/4 C fresh parsley, chopped

### Dumplings

- 1 1/2 C all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1/3 C milk

## Instructions

Make [chicken stock](chicken_stock.md), having removed any spare meat from the chicken carcass and reserved it.

Heat a stock pot. Add olive oil, and sweat onions and celery until onions are translucent, about 7 minutes.

Add the garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Pour stock into stock pot. Add carrots.

Bring to a boil, and cook for 15 minutes. While cooking, make Dumpling dough:

Mix together dry ingredients. Add wet ingredients, and stir with a silicone spatula until just combined.

When the 15 minutes are up, drop by the (cutlery) teaspoon into the soup, and cook until done, 10 - 12 minutes.

Add the reserved chicken and parsley.

Serve immediately.
