2 oz Kuhl Whipped Cream Vodka
1 oz Kiki Key Lime Liqueur
1 oz sweet & sour mix
1/2 oz fresh lime juice
Graham crackers, crushed
Honey or simple syrup for rimming
Lime wheel for garnish

Prepare the glass: Pour a small amount of honey or simple syrup onto a
shallow plate. Pour crushed graham crackers onto another plate. Dip
the rim of a chilled martini glass or coupe into the honey, then into
the graham cracker crumbs to coat. Set aside.

Fill a cocktail shaker with ice. Add the whipped cream vodka, key lime
liqueur, sweet & sour mix, and lime juice.

Shake vigorously for 15-20 seconds until well chilled.

Strain into the prepared glass.

Garnish with a lime wheel on the rim.

Serve immediately.
