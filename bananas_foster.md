# Bananas Foster

Serves two.

## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp unsalted butter
- ¼ C (1.75 oz) dark brown sugar
- ¼ tsp ground allspice
- ½ tsp freshly ground nutmeg
- 2 bananas, sliced into half-inch rounds
- ¼ C dark rum
- 1 Tbsp banana liqueur or (less ideally) 1 Tbsp dark rum
- Vanilla ice cream
- ½ tsp finely grated orange zest (optional)

## Instructions

Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the Tbsp of liquid, then the brown sugar, allspice, and nutmeg. Stir until brown sugar is melted. Add the bananas, and cook for one minute. Then, flip the bananas and cook for one more minute.

Remove the bananas, increase heat, add the ¼ C of rum, and light it on fire. After the rum burns off, cook the sauce down for 1 - 2 minutes until it is syrupy. If adding the orange zest, add it now. Add the 1 Tbsp of rum.

Serve the ice cream, place the banana slices over the ice cream, and pour the sauce over the ice cream.
