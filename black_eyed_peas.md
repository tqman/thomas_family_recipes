- 2 11oz tubs fresh black-eyed peas
- 1 sweet onion, diced
- 4 celery stalks, sliced
- 14 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 Thai chili, sliced thin, with seeds
- 4 thick-cut slices of bacon, sliced into 1/4" strip
- 5 C chicken stock
- 2 tsp cajun spice
- 1 tsp salt

Place the bacon slices into a cold dutch oven on a stovetop. Set heat
to medium, and cook, stirring occasionally, until fat has rendered
and bacon is crispy, about eight minutes.

Add the onion, chili, cajun spice, salt, and celery to the pot, and
cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are translucent, about
seven minutes.

Add garlic to pot and cook until fragrant, about thirty seconds.

Add a small amount of chicken stock to the pot, and scrape the bottom
with a wooden spoon to deglaze anything stuck.

Add the black-eyed peas and remaining chicken stock to pot, and
increase heat to high until stock is boiling. Reduce heat to a simmer
and cook, stirring occasionally, until it thickens up, 30 - 40
minutes.
