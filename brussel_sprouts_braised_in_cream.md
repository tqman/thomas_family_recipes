# Brussels Sprouts Braised in Cream

## Ingredients

- 1 lbs small Brussels sprouts, stem end trimmed and discolored leaves removed
- 1 C heavy cream
- 1/2 tsp salt
- Freshly grated nutmeg
- Ground black pepper

## Instructions

Bring the sprouts, cream and salt to a boil in a two-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Cover and simmer, shaking the pan once or twice to prevent sticking. Cook until a sharp knife tip inserted into the center of a sprout meets no resistance, 10 - 12 minutes.

Season with nutmeg and pepper to taste. Serve immediately. May be kept warm in a slow cooker.
