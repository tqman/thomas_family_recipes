# Pecan Pie

## Current Recipe

### Ingredients

- 1 whole unbaked pie crust
- 1 C white sugar
- 3 Tbsp brown sugar
- ¾ tsp salt
- 1 C corn syrup
- ¾ tsp vanilla
- ⅓ C melted butter
- 3 whole eggs, beaten
- 1 C heaping chopped pecans

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350F.
2. Place the pie crust in a pie pan, if it isn't already.
3. Mix sugar, brown sugar, salt, corn syrup, butter, eggs, and vanilla together in a bowl.
4. Pour the chopped pecans into the bottom of the unbaked pie shell.
5. Pour the syrup mixture over the top. Cover the top and crust gently with foil, and bake for 30 minutes.
6. Remove the foil, and continue to bake for 20 minutes.
7. Pie should not be overly jiggly when removed. If it is, re-cover with foil, and bake for up to an additional 20 minutes until set.

### Notes

Assuming 8 pieces and a Marie Calendars frozen pie crust, this is 562 calories per slice.

## Old Recipe (BROKEN - DO NOT USE)

**This recipe is broken. Find another one. Two years in a row the filling did not set.**


### Ingredients

- 1 recipe Pie Dough for Prebaked Pie Shell
- 6 Tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 C packed dark brown sugar
- ½ tsp salt
- 3 large eggs
- ¾ C light corn syrup
- 1 Tbsp vanilla extract
- 2 C pecans, toasted and chopped into small pieces (to toast, bake at 350F for 10 minutes)

### Instructions

1. Pre-heat an oven to 375F if not making the pie shell recipe (if you are, do that first and the oven will be at 375F when you're done).
2. Melt the butter in a medium heatproof bowl set in a skillet of water maintained at just below a simmer.
3. Remove the bowl from the skillet; stir in the brown sugar and salt with a wooden spoon until the butter is absorbed.
4. Beat in the eggs, then the corn syrup and vanilla.
5. Return the bowl to the hot water; stir until the mixture is shiny and hot to the touch, about 130 degrees F.
6. Remove from the heat; stir in the pecans.
7. Lower the oven temperature to 275F. Pour the pecan mixture into the pie shell.
8. Bake on the middle rack until the pie looks set and yet soft, like gelatin, when gently pressed with the back of a spoon, 50 to 60 minutes.
9. Transfer the pie to a rack; cool completely, at least 4 hours.
10. To re-warm for serving, place in a 250F oven for about 15 minutes.
