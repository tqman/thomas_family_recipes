1/2 C lime juice
1/3 C dry red wine
2 tsp olive oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 onion, minced
1 Tbsp dried oregano
2 bay leaves
1 tsp fresh-ground black pepper
1 scotch bonnet or jalapeno pepper, minced, optional

First time I made it I also put in 1/4 C low-sodium soy sauce since
there's no salt there
