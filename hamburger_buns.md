# Hamburger Buns

## Ingredients

- 170g 95F water
- 1 Tbsp instant yeast
- 1 large egg
- 2 Tbsp (ideally room temperature) unsalted butter
- 418 g all-purpose flour
- 8 g salt
- 50g sugar
- 3 Tbsp melted butter (used during baking, not making dough, so don't melt it yet)

## Instructions

Add the water to the mixing bowl. Sprinkle in 1 Tbsp yeast, and let bloom for five minutes.

Add the remaining ingredients to a mixer, and combine on low speed. The dough should pull away from the bowl and make a ball; if it does not, it is too wet and you should add more flour.

Knead on medium for 4 minutes.

Remove the dough hook, and shape the dough into a rough ball in the mixing bowl.

Cover the bowl, and let it rise for 90 minutes or until doubled in bulk.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently deflate it, and divide it into eight pieces with a dough knife. On the work surface, shape each piece into a ball, and then flatten it with floured hands until it is about 3" across. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, cover with a dish towel, and let rise for about an hour.

Preheat an oven to 350F, and melt the 3 Tbsp butter. Brush the tops of the buns with about half the butter, and place in oven for 15 minutes, or until golden brown.

Remove from oven and brush the buns with the remaining melted butter. Cool on a rack.
