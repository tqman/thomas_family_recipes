# Sourdough Pancakes

## Ingredients

### 3 to 24 Hours Before

- 1 C sourdough starter
- 2 C water
- 2½ C whole grain flour

### The Next Morning

- 3 large eggs
- 4 Tbsp maple syrup, honey, maple sugar, or rapadura (optional)
- ¼ C coconut oil or melted butter
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt

## Instructions

3 to 24 hours before you want to eat, combine in a large bowl the starter, water, and flour. Make sure that you have plenty of room for this mixture to rise. If it is a very hot day, beware of leaving it too long as it will ferment very quickly. Usually make this up the night before for breakfast, or the morning of for dinner. In colder weather, you can do this recipe for up to 24 hours.

After the soaking period, add the rest of the ingredients, and combine well. A whisk is helpful. If you want thinner pancakes you can thin with water (or milk). Drop about 1/4 of a cup of the batter on a lightly oiled hot griddle (over medium to medium-high heat) until the the top is set, and the bottom lightly browned. Flip the pancake and cook until the pancake is lightly browned on the other side. Repeat until all of the batter is used, re-oiling the pan as needed.

## Notes

20090411 - These made crepe-like pancakes that everyone but Blake loved.

### Alternative Recipe (Not Actually Made)

From Nancy Silverton's *Breads from the La Brea Bakery*. This recipe combines active starter with a small amount of maple syrup, oil, eggs, salt, baking soda and powder. Surprisingly, even Silverton added baking powder and soda, since she's a big advocate of natural leavening. Her recipe also called for two eggs and 2 tablespoons of syrup per two cups of starter, which struck me as a lot for that amount of flour. After scaling back the eggs and sugar and substituting butter for oil:

- 4 C starter
- 2 Tbsp syrup
- 3 Tbsp butter, melted
- 2 eggs
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ tsp baking soda
- ½ tsp baking powder

Feed the starter the night before, so it's active and bubbly by morning. For flour use a mix of bread flour (which is what normally goes in starter) and all-purpose flour (which is normally used for pancakes). In the morning combine all the other ingredients, add them to the starter, and mix until just incorporated. (Too much mixing would develop more gluten, meaning tougher pancakes.) Then cook them off on a griddle over medium heat, adjusting the batter and the temperature as needed so the pancakes spread nicely on the griddle and don't stick.

The resulting pancakes were a big hit, less cakey and more bread-like than most pancakes, but still light and fluffy, and with the expected, barely-soured flavor. In short, they had character, and people seemed to like them.

As an aside, Nancy Silverton's book gets a mixed review. It's full of excellent information, but many of the recipes are so detailed, running onto multiple pages, that they're impossible to follow when you're up to your arms in dough. Recipes should always be separated into the rambling part -- like this -- and the procedural part, which should be as succinct as possible.

### Notes, 20090404 (Saturday)

Started sponge at 0910. Made everything Sunday. Note baking powder below was an addition. Nobody liked how these came out.

- 1 C warm water
- 1 C white flour
- ½ C sourdough starter dough (half a tangerine)
- 2 C milk
- 2½ C whole grain flour
- 3 large eggs
- 4 Tbsp sugar (or maple syrup!)
- 3 Tbsp melted butter
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt

24 hours before, mix warm water, white flour and dough. Cover and let stand.

About fifteen minutes before baking, melt the butter, and combine with eggs. Add milk. Then, mix all other ingredients together.
