# Roast Chicken

## Ingredients

- Whole chicken
- Fresh thyme
- 5 cloves garlic
- 5 Tbsp butter
- Salt
- Pepper
- High-temperature oil
- 1 lbs small potatoes, skin-on
- 1 lbs carrots

## Instructions

Preheat a convection oven to 425F.

Scrub the potatoes. Peel the carrots, and cut into 2" lengths. Crush the garlic cloves.

Remove the gizzards from the chicken. Into the cavity, place the thyme and garlic.

Place the vegetables in a cast-iron skillet. Toss with the high-temperature oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Place the bird on the vegetables, breast side up, and generously season with salt and pepper. Place the butter on top of the breast, sliced into individual Tbsp.

Roast at 425F until an internal temperature of 144F is reached (generally about an hour and a half).

If you're roasting a smaller chicken, it may be done in fewer than 90 minutes. If so, remove the chicken from the vegetables, and keep roasting those for the remainder of the 90 minutes, or until they are soft.

Remove from the oven and let rest for fifteen minutes.

Carve and serve immediately.
