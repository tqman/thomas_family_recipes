# Smoked Mussels

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs fresh mussels
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1 lemon, cut into wedges
- Hickory or mesquite wood chips

## Instructions

Clean the mussels under cold running water, scrubbing off any debris and pulling off the beards. Discard any mussels that are open and won't close when tapped.

In a large bowl, toss the cleaned mussels with olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper.

Prepare a Weber grill for indirect heat at 225-250°F. Add the wood chips to the coals.

Place the mussels in a disposable aluminum pan or directly on the grate over the indirect heat zone.

Smoke for 15-25 minutes, until the mussels have opened. Discard any mussels that haven't opened.

Serve immediately with lemon wedges.

## Notes

20090620: Did 39 minutes, was very yummy but maybe just a hair overdone. Based on current research, 15-25 minutes is more appropriate at this temperature.

Watch carefully near the end - mussels can go from perfect to rubbery quickly.
