# Butter Chicken

## Ingredients

### Marinade

- 28 oz boneless and skinless chicken thighs or breasts cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1/2 C plain yogurt
- 1 1/2 Tbsp garlic minced
- 1 Tbsp ginger minced, or finely grated
- 2 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp red chili powder
- 1 tsp salt

### Sauce

- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 2 Tbsp butter
- 1 large onion sliced or chopped
- 1 1/2 Tbsp garlic minced
- 1 Tbsp ginger minced or finely grated
- 1 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1 1/2 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 14 oz crushed tomatoes
- 2 tsp red chili powder, adjust to taste preference
- 1 1/2 tsp salt or to taste
- 1 C heavy cream
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp kasoori methi or dried fenugreek leaves

## Instructions

Combine chicken with ingredients from the marinade in a 2 gal. ziploc bag, and massage until all ingredients are incorporated and evenly coat the chicken. Marinate for at least 30 minutes, but preferably 6 hours or overnight.

Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken pieces in small batches. The pieces should not crowd each other in the pan, at most barely touching. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side, and set aside.

Heat butter or ghee in the same pan. Fry the onions until they start to sweat (about 6 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan.

Add garlic and ginger and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant, then add ground coriander, cumin, and garam masala. Let cook for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.

Add crushed tomatoes, chili powder and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.

Remove from heat and blend sauce with an immersion blender. You may need to add a couple tablespoons of water to help it blend (up to 1/4 cup).

Pour the puréed sauce back into the pan. Stir the cream, sugar and crushed kasoori methi (or fenugreek leaves) through the sauce. Add the chicken with juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling.

Garnish with chopped cilantro if you feel fancy, and serve with rice or naan.

## Notes

For the ingredients in the sauce, they will all be blended before eaten. As a result, it's not as necessary to get the onion and other ingredients cut as small compared to if they were eaten straight.
