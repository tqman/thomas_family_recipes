## Instructions

1. **For the braise:** Bring the salt pork, reserved pork rind, and 3 C of water to boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Boil 2 minutes, then drain well.

2. Cut two 22-inch lengths of cheesecloth. Wrap the parsley, thyme, onions, carrots, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, and blanched salt pork rind in the cheesecloth and tie with butcher's twine to make a bouquet garni. Place bouquet in a large Dutch oven. Preheat an oven to 300°F.

3. Place diced salt pork in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté until lightly browned and crisp, about 12 minutes. Remove to a bowl with a slotted spoon, and pour off and reserve most of the pork fat. Pat the beef dry with paper towels and generously season with salt and pepper. Use about 2 Tbsp of the reserved pork fat to brown half the beef, turning once or twice, until deep brown, about 7 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to the Dutch oven. Deglaze the pan with 1/2 C of broth, then pour the deglazing liquid into the Dutch oven. Repeat with the remaining pork fat and beef, deglazing with another 1/2 C of broth before adding to the Dutch oven.

4. Add the butter to the now-empty skillet. When foaming subsides, whisk in the flour until evenly moistened and pasty. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has a toasty aroma and resembles a light-colored peanut butter. Gradually whisk in the remaining broth. Increase heat to medium high and bring to a simmer, stirring frequently, until thickened. Pour mixture into the Dutch oven. Add 3 C of wine, and salt and pepper to taste to the Dutch oven and stir to combine. Set Dutch oven over high heat and bring to a boil. Cover and place the pot in the oven. Cook until the meat is tender, 2.5 - 3 hours.

5. Remove the Dutch oven from the oven and transfer the bouquet garni to a mesh strainer set over the pot. Press the liquid back into the pot and discard the bouquet. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon. Allow the liquid to settle, and remove the fat. Bring the liquid to a boil. Simmer briskly, stirring occasionally to ensure the bottom is not burning, until the sauce is reduced to about 3 cups and thickened to the consistency of heavy cream, 15 to 25 minutes.

6. While the sauce is reducing, bring the pearl onions, butter, sugar, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/2 C of the water to a boil in a medium skillet over high heat. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, shaking the pan occasionally, until the onions are tender, about 5 minutes. Uncover, increase the heat to high, and simmer until all of the liquid evaporates, about 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms and 1/4 tsp salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid released by the mushrooms evaporates and the vegetables are browned and glazed, about 5 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to a large plate and set aside. Add the remaining 1/4 C of water to the skillet and stir with a wooden spoon to loosen the browned bits. When the pan bottom and sides are clean, add the liquid to the reducing sauce.

7. When the sauce in the Dutch oven has reduced to about 3 C and thickened to the consistency of heavy cream, reduce the heat to medium-low. Stir in the beef, mushrooms and onions (and any accumulated juices), the remaining wine, and the brandy. Cover the pot and cook until just heated through, 5 - 8 minutes. Adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper to taste and serve, sprinkling the individual servings with the minced parsley.
