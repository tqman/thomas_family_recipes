New hotness:

2 boneless chicken breasts, with or without skin (about ⅔ lbs total)
3 cloves of garlic and an equivalent amount of fresh ginger
5 scallions, white parts only
2 Tbsp peanut oil
a generous handful of dried red chiles (at least 10), preferably Sichuanese
1 tsp whole Sichuan pepper
⅔ C roasted unsalted peanuts (or cashews)

For the marinade:
½ tsp salt
2 tsp light soy sauce
1 tsp Shaoxing rice wine or medium-dry sherry
1½ tsp potato flour or 2¼ tsp cornstarch
1 Tbsp water

For the sauce:

1 Tbsp sugar
¾ tsp potato flour or 1⅛ tsp cornstarch
1 tsp dark soy sauce
1 tsp light soy sauce
1 Tbsp Chinkiang or black Chinese vinegar
1 tsp sesame oil
1 Tbsp chicken stock or water

1. Cut the chicken as evenly as possible into ½-inch strips and then
cut these into small cubes. Place in a small bowl and mix in the
marinade ingredients.

2. Peel and thinly slice the garlic and ginger, and chop the scallions
into chunks as long as their diameter (to match the chicken
cubes). Snip the chiles in half or into 2-inch sections. Wearing
rubber gloves, discard as many seeds as possible.

3. Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl  if you dip your
finger in, you can taste the sweet-sour base of the gong bao flavor.

4. Season the wok, then add 2 Tbsp of oil and heat over a high
flame. When the oil is hot but not yet smoking, add the chiles and
Sichuan pepper and stir-fry briefly until they are crisp and the oil
is spicy and fragrant. Take care not to burn the spices (you can
remove the wok from the heat if necessary to prevent overheating).

5. Quickly add the chicken and fry over a high flame, stirring
constantly. As soon as the chicken cubes have separated, add the
ginger, garlic, and scallions and continue to stir-fry for a few
minutes until they are fragrant and the meat is cooked through (test
one of the larger pieces to make sure).

6. Give the sauce a stir and add it to the wok, continuing to stir and
toss. As soon as the sauce has become thick and shiny, add the
peanuts, stir them in, and serve.

Cooking:
Oil the wok. Add the chiles and peppers, cook for < 30 seconds.

Add the chicken. Stir fry constantly until the pieces star to break
up.

Add the ginger, garlic and scallions, cook for two minutes

Add the sauce. As soon as the sauce thickens, add the peanuts, stir, and serve

Variations

The same dish can be made with cubes of pork, shrimp, or prawns.

Cashew nuts can be used instead of peanuts for a grander version of this dish, although peanuts are more traditional.

I think this needs about ½ c peanuts, double the cornstarch batter
and more vinegar. Also, whole peppers might make it less spicy.


Ingredients


(4 servings)


1 c Peanuts 1 lb Chicken; breast, cut 1" pcs


Marinade; chicken: 2 ts Rice wine ;or dry sherry 1 ts Cornstarch 1 ts
Sesame oil 1½ tb Dark soy sauce 2 tb Red wine vinegar 2 ts Sugar 2
tb Peanut oil;or corn oil ½ ts Salt 8 Sm Red chile,;dried, seeded 2
ts Ginger; fresh minced 4 cl Garlic; minced 1 Bell pepper; seeded, cut in


Instructions


ROAST THE PEANUTS IN A 325F oven until golden brown (about 10
minutes). Re- move and set aside. To make marinade, mix together rice
wine, cornstarch and 1 tsp Asian sesame oil. In a bowl, toss the
chicken with the marinade; set aside until ready to cook. In a small bowl,
mix well soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and other tsp of sesame oil. Over
medium heat, preheat wok until hot. Add oil, salt and dried red chiles;
cook until chiles are charred (about 15 seconds). Add ginger and garlic;
stir-fry until fragrant and lightly browned (about 30 seconds). Increase
to high heat, add bell peppers and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the
chicken into the wok and stir-fry a minute or until the cubes feel
firm to the touch and are opaque white in color. It should take no
more than a total of 2 minutes. Now stir in sauce mixture; toss and
stir until it thickens into a glaze (about 30 seconds). Remove wok from
heat. Add reserved roasted peanuts, fold together. Serve hot. Selden,
here is my version of General Tso Chicken, which is also known as Kung
Pao Chicken. When charring the chile peppers, be sure the ventilation
is on and avoid breathing the strong chile fumes. The charring creates
a desirable smoky flavor. Serves 4 to 6 with other dishes. GUEST CHEF
