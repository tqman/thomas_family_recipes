# Pasta Dough

## Ingredients

- ⅔ C + 1 Tbsp All-Purpose Flour (4oz)
- ½ C + 2 Tbsp Semolina Flour (4oz)
- 6 large egg yolks
- 1 large egg
- 1½ tsp olive oil
- 1 Tbsp milk or dry white wine (e.g. Pinot Grigio)

## Instructions

1. Place all ingredients in mixing bowl, and mix together using flat mixer until combined, about two minutes.
2. Switch to bread hook and knead for 2 minutes.
3. Dust a work surface (and your hands) with flour, and knead by hand for 2 minutes.
4. Double-wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes - 1 hour before rolling through pasta machine. Dough can be made a day ahead, wrapped and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before rolling.
