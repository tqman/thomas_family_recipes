20130815: Tried 1 Tbsp pepper, 1 tsp chili, 1 Tbsp salt - was still a
bit too salty. Try 1.5 tsp salt next time. Also, on a 2.5 lbs brisket,
don't use all of it. Cooked 'til 175 in the smoker at 300, and it was
a *little* tough but not bad. Next time could go 'til 180.

20120902: Rub below (3 Tbsp pepper, 2 tsp chili, 1 tsp cayenne, 2 Tbsp
salt) was *way* too peppery and a little too salty.
