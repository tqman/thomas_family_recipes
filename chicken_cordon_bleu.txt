2/3 cup panko bread crumbs
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
Salt and pepper
2 ounces Gruyère cheese
4 slices deli ham (4 ounces)
2 (6- to 8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts
4 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 large egg, lightly beaten

INSTRUCTIONS

Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 400
degrees. Toss panko with melted butter, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4
teaspoon pepper in 8 1/2 by 4 1/2-inch loaf pan until combined. Bake
until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring halfway through
baking. Let cool completely.

Roll each piece of Gruyère in 1 slice of ham, folding edges of ham
over so no cheese is exposed. Using sharp knife, cut each chicken
breast in half horizontally into 2 equal-size cutlets. Season chicken
with salt and pepper and spread 1 teaspoon mustard evenly on cut side
of each cutlet. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, place 1
ham-and-­Gruyère roll 1 inch from thick end of mustard side of cutlet
and roll up tightly. Secure each chicken roll with toothpick and set
aside, seam side down.

Brush tops of chicken rolls with egg and dip into panko mixture,
pressing gently to adhere. Discard remaining panko mixture. Arrange
chicken rolls, crumb side up, in now-empty loaf pan. Bake until
chicken registers 160 degrees, 30 to 35 minutes, rotating pan halfway
through cooking. Remove toothpicks and serve.
