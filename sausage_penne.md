# Sausage Penne

## Ingredients

- 1 lbs Italian sausage (sweet or mild, as desired)
- 1 lbs fresh sliced Mozzarella
- 4 servings (208g) penne
- Sauce from [marinara_skillet.md](marinara_skillet.md), cooked for an extra 5 - 10 minutes to reduce water, or marinara purchased from market

## Instructions

Bring water to a boil. Add the penne and cook according to package instructions.

While that's boiling, brown sausage in a 12" oven-safe pan, and drain.

When the penne is done, drain and add to the pan with the marinara, and stir all ingredients to mix well. Add the mozzarella slices to cover the pan.

Broil until the cheese is melted and and starting to brown. This is generally 5 - 10 minutes, but watch it closely as it goes from brown to burned very quickly.

Let rest 5 minutes so the cheese can set before cutting and serving.
