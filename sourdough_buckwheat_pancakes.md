# Sourdough Buckwheat Pancakes

## Ingredients

### The Night Before

- 2 C warm milk (95F)
- 1 C (147g) buckwheat flour
- ¼ C (90g) sourdough starter

### The Next Morning

- 2 eggs
- 2 Tbsp melted butter
- 1 C (120g) all-purpose flour
- ¾ tsp salt
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 2 tsp sugar

## Instructions

The night before: Mix the warm milk, buckwheat flour, and sourdough starter. Cover and put in a warm place overnight.

The next morning: Add the eggs, melted butter, all-purpose flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and sugar. Mix and cook.

If you don't have overnight, you can still mix this the same morning and get something decent. The more time for the sourdough to ferment, the better, but it's not a huge difference.
