# Spaghetti Bolognese

## Ingredients

- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 2 sweet onions, diced
- 2 carrots, diced
- 2 stalks celery, diced
- ½ tsp kosher salt
- ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 1 lbs extra lean ground beef
- ½ lbs ground pork
- ¼ lbs diced pancetta
- 7 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 Tbsp tomato paste
- ½ C dry red wine
- 28 oz crushed San Marzano tomatoes
- ½ C chopped Italian parsley, split
- ¼ C heavy cream
- Kosher salt and freshly-ground black pepper

## Instructions

Heat pot. Add oil to coat bottom, and add the 2 Tbsp of tomato paste.

Sauté the onions, carrots, and celery until onions are translucent, 7 minutes.

Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute.

Add beef, pork, pancetta, salt, and pepper. Break up and stir in until meat is browned, 10 minutes.

Deglaze the pan with the red wine, scraping to get any browned bits up from the bottom. Add the tomatoes and half of the parsley. Set the pressure cooker to "high" cook for twenty minutes. At the end of 20 minutes, do an immediate pressure release. When pressure is down, take off lid, and cook on high heat for another 10 minutes to thicken the sauce, stirring frequently.

Stir in the remaining parsley and cream.
