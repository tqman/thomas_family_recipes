# Shabu Shabu

## Ingredients

### Sesame Dipping Sauce

- 6 Tbsp white sesame seeds
- 3 Tbsp mirin
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1 Tbsp vinegar
- 2½ Tbsp soysauce
- ½ tsp grated garlic
- ½ C dashi soup

### Ponzu Sauce

- ⅓ C soy sauce
- ¼ C lemon juice
- 1 Tbsp rice wine vinegar
- ⅓ C dashi soup

### Kombu Dashi

- 2 C water
- 1 4" square of kombu, wiped clean (not washed)

### For Shabu Shabu

- 2 NY strip steaks (or similar beef)
- Carrots
- Chinese cabbage
- Scallions
- Shitake mushrooms

## Instructions

### Sesame Dipping Sauce

Grind sesame seeds well. Pour mirin gradually over the sesame seeds, mixing together. Add sugar, vinegar, and soy sauce in the sauce. Further, add grated garlic and mix well. Pour dashi stock gradually, stirring well.

Makes 4 servings

### Kombu Dashi

Soak kombu in the water for 30 minutes, then bring the water to a boil. Just before the water boils, remove the kombu.

### Ponzu Sauce

I found this to be WAY too lemony with fresh lemon juice (was juice of one lemon). Half as much, maybe.

## Notes

The Shabu Shabu itself I made with two NY strip steaks, carrots, Chinese cabbage, scallions and shitake mushrooms (which Betsy apparently hates).
