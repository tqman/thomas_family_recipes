20071110:

Did as below, but added 1.5C of water, and cooked with 2C of California
Basmati Rice (also listed as 2:3 on the packaged) in the steamer.

Experiment 20071103:

I put in:

4 pureed tomatoes
1/2 pureed giant "Vidalia" (Peruvian actually) onion
Juice of one lime
1 teaspoon oregano
1/2 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 C cilantro
1/4 C olive oil
1/4 C tequila
3 garlic cloves, chopped
1 tsp ground black pepper

I pureed all of that, which made about 2C of liquid stuff

Then I put 1 1/2C of that, with all the white rice I had (about 1C of
jasmine) in the steamer. The rice requested 2:3 rice:liquid ratio.

The result was a little undercooked all around, and burned on the
bottom. Dunno if more rice and more liquid would've been better.

Betsy decribed it as "creamy" and "risotto" like and really liked it.
A good addition in the future would be some sort of broth.
