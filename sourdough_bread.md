# Sourdough Bread

## Ingredients

### Preparing the Sponge (night before)

- 1 C flour
- 1 C warm water
- Sourdough starter

### For the Bread

- 3 C unbleached flour
- 4 tsp sugar (or 2 Tbsp)
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 C sponge (proofed starter)
- 2 Tbsp olive oil or softened margarine (optional)

## Instructions

### Night Before

Take out the starter, place it in another container, and add 1 C of flour and 1 C of warm water. Let sit overnight. While it's sitting, wash the sourdough starter canister.

### The Next Day

Take 2 C of sponge, and place it in a large mixing bowl. Take any remaining sponge, and add it and 1 C of warm water and 1 C of flour back into the starter canister. Let it sit on the counter for 8 or more hours, then place it back in the fridge.

To the 2 C of sponge, add the sugar, salt, and oil (the oil is optional - you can use softened butter instead, or no oil at all). Mix well, then knead in the flour a half-cup at a time. Knead in enough flour to make a good, flexible bread dough.

The rise should take at least eight hours. You can have success by warming things up (by, for example, turning on the oven for a minute, then letting the loaf rise there).

Place the pizza stone in the oven, and heat to 450 degrees. Bake for 20-25 minutes, spraying with water every 10 minutes. Works best straight on the stone rather than on parchment.

## Notes

20090427 - Made yesterday. Just dumped all the ingredients (dry first) in the bread machine and left it alone. I'd proofed the starter at about 1900 Saturday; made dough at about 0800 Sunday. Let it rise almost exactly 8 hours - gave it one shot of 1 minute in the oven at the start, then another after 6 hours. Cooked it on the baking stone about 23 minutes at 450 - I think it wanted 20.

20090417 - made this last weekend (20090411ish), and it worked perfectly. I did hand mix and knead it, and I let it rise about eight hours while occasionally heating up the oven and what-not to get the temp up.

Just made the dough for this weekend - I added 2 1/2 C of flour basically immediately to the bread machine, but then had to do a lot of work with the spoon to get everything combined at about 15 minutes into the mix/knead cycle. I let it rise in the bread machine (no real change), then turned it out on to a baking sheet and covered it. I'm planning on letting it rise something like 18 hours (a lot of it overnight), and it's supposed to be pretty warm, tomorrow, so we'll see what we get.

I think I may also be leaving the sponge alone too long after refreshing, since I refreshed it about 24 hours ago. For the sourdough buns for the burgers tomorrow, I refreshed the sponge tonight, and I'm planning on making the dough first thing tomorrow and letting it rise, tomorrow.

20090405 - The second dough failed to rise and was inedible.

On Saturday morning, I took an unknown amount of doughish starter (I'm guessing it was a half-tangerine sized piece), and added in 1 C of warm water and 1 C of flour. I let this sit at room temperature, covered, for 24 hours.

I then added the sponge, and 2½ C flour, 1½ tsp salt, and ¾ C cool water in the bread machine, and mixed it up. I then let it rise in the machine's cycle.

When it came out, it seemed wet to me, so I kneaded in about another half cup of flour, and kneaded it by hand for about five minutes. I then let it rise for eight hours, and cooked it for 25 minutes at 450 degrees, misting with water every ten minutes.

### First Successful Loaf

I used 2 C of sponge, 3 C of flour, 2 Tbsp olive oil, 4 tsp sugar and 2 tsp salt. Poured all of that into the bread machine. Discovered I had to add a little extra water to get it all to combine.

Let it rise in the bread machine, then let it sit there and rise for another hour. Removed it, kneaded it, added a bit more flour, and shaped it into a loaf. Cut the loaf in four places on the top, covered with a damp cloth, and left in the sun to rise for another 90 minutes.

Placed the pizza stone in the oven, and heated it to 450 degrees, with a pie pan full of water on the top rack to provide moisture.

Cooked it for about 33 minutes. Crust was delicious. I thought it probably could've risen a bit longer. Also, everyone agreed they'd like it to be "more sour", so perhaps I should let the sponge ferment longer.

### Making Sourdough Starter

Started with 1/4 C of flour, 2 Tbsp of water on 3/30/09. Kneaded a biscuit that rose in a couple of days.

On Wednesday, 4/1/09, I removed a "tangerine sized piece" and mixed in 1 C of flour and a little bit of water.

On Thursday, 4/2/09, I added a bit more than 1 C of flour and some water to make it dough-like consistency.

To make a sourdough sponge: 2 C warm water, 2 C flour, and the tangerine sized piece of starter. Cover with plastic wrap, and leave overnight (about 20 hours). This made 2¾ C of starter.
