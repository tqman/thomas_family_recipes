# Green Beans

## Ingredients

- 1 1/4 lbs green beans, washed and trimmed
- 1/2 small onion
- 1/2 C sliced raw almonds
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 C red wine
- 6 cloves garlic, chopped
- 4 C chicken broth (guessing)
- 1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 2 Tbsp butter
- Flour or cornstarch for thickening

## Instructions

Toast the almonds by putting them in a large, deep frying pan with 1 Tbsp of butter. Keep them moving, and keep an eye on them - they go from raw to cooked in about minute. Remove from pan and wipe it out.

Sweat the onions in the remaining butter in the pan for 6 - 7 minutes or until translucent. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Add the salt, broth, and vinegar. Bring to a boil. Add green beans, and cook 8-10 minutes or until desired doneness.

Remove the green beans, and drain off all but about 1C of liquid. Add red wine, and return to a boil. Add flour or cornstarch to thicken sauce.

Toss the green beans, the almonds and the sauce, and serve.

## Historical Notes

Past notes left here to show evolution as the recipe progressed since these all predate using GitHub. Oldest note was a fragment from 12/15/07.

**Notes, 12/29/08:** I did 3 of broth (homemade turkey broth from Thanksgiving). I put in a *ton* of flour to thicken it; too much. There was also too much sauce relative to the beans. Next year I'd think no more than 2C of broth - maybe 1.

**Notes, 12/26/09:** Did about 1C of chicken broth (canned, all I had). It thickened up with about 1 1/2 tsp of flour, but there wasn't enough of it. I think 2C might be a sweet spot. Also, the beans had a slightly "boiled" taste to them - I'm wondering whether it doesn't make sense to steam them first, then throw them in the pan with the sauce while it thickens.
